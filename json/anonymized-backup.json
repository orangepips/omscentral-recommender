You should get both BOOK s, do further research on the internet, do the supplimental exercises, participate in Piazza, go to office hours, join a study group, etc. But most importantly, just stick it out.

As others have noted, the class does have 2 distinct parts. The first part is theoretical, and the second part dives into some pretty heavy topics with algorithm analysis. I actually found the first half of the class easier to understand just because of the shear volume of information in the second part. As far as time commitment, you have 8 assignments due roughly every 2 weeks, and each assignment took me ~10 hours or so. Add in time for going through the lectures and studying/preparing for the tests. Grading is very fair. I really like Charles as an instructor and a TA, and he is very involved and approachable.

The best resource was Piazza forum - maximizes your understanding and lots of help. The homeworks are a great way to learn and mostly tailor along the recommended BOOK s - so that was quite a relief!

So, office hours are not very helpful. \nProf and some TAs are 'sensitive' to the discourse among the students. So, when people expressed too many conserns with the course, professor responded with the warnings about plagiarizm in homeworks and actually lowered the grades of several students. That worked, and no one complained much sinse. \nPiazza messaging was very active, but mostly from those who were 'lost'. Those who could be helpful did not really try to help because they were afraid to break 'code of conduct' by giving too much help, and also because of the curve (if others fail, your grade goes up).

Other than that, there are a lot of lectures to get through and papers to read, but no hard deadline for them other than the exams. I'd recommend getting as much done ahead of time as possible, but the class offers a lot of flexibility with the time demand. I'd never written a line of C before taking the class, but was familiar with C++. The projects took about a weekend each, but every hour of that weekend. I spent far more time in the first half than the second half after realizing how questions are effectively recycled for the exams from past terms. They provided us with review questions and past exams with solution keys. Use those to guide what you memorize in minute detail and you can cut down how much you need to study. ",

If you do take it, assume what you have been told in your assignments is not enough and that there will be corrections that you can ONLY find in some burried thread on Piazza. The class have been basically unprofessional. For a class that is in its 3rd run I don't know why it is this bad. KBAI was infinitely better on its first run. The videos are nice and the homework itself isn't bad but when you have a case where a you do what is in the homework and match their pictures, only to have things rejected because of OTHER unannounced parameters.. its not good. Or to then have them request you copy and paste output from a terminal, only to find out that they watned MORE than they explicicity asked for is bad. What makes it worse than just all of that is their refusal to make a group announcement about the subject where it states EVERYTHING in one clear place. Instead you have to go through a whole Piazza post. Just awful. ",

There is no professor involved with the course at this point, so it is entirely run by a group of TAs who do their best to make everything work but don't have the resources, time, or authority to fix the aspects of the course that are broken. The course consists of lectures, which in general are interesting and easy to follow, short Python networking assignments, and quizzes. If all of these were integrated into the Udacity system as they were originally when the course was created, everything would be much easier to deal with. Instead, the current TAs are locked out of the Udacity backend and have to create their own autograding system and quiz questions from scratch. Autograding has been a mess, with students receiving zero scores for seemingly correct work with no explanation, such as programming assigningments where the code is completely correct or quiz submissions where there is an extra newline at the end of the file. The TAs are spending a lot of time regrading and fixing these grading errors, but it's a huge distraction from the actual coursework. The quiz questions themselves are the weakest and newest part of the course, many of the questions are incorrect and are changed before the deadline, worded ambiguously due to grammar or other issues, cover material outside of the course itself, or use terminology and techniques simlar to but different from the course material. All these issues mean that there is a large backlog of questions from students on Piazza, and the TAs have a hard time keeping up. To succeed in this course procrastination is basically mandatory, because critical clarifications and changes to the quizzes and assignments will often only be posted a few days before the deadline. Aside all of these issues, the material in the course itself is very approachable and the workload is very reasonable in terms of time. I wish the higher level staff would do something to address the problems faced by both students and TAs in this course, because otherwise I would recommend this course a good way to get started in the OMSCS program without getting overwhelmed by courses that involve more advanced skills and a larger time committment.

(The majority of the students are probably older, and likely more experienced than the TAs, so that's a factor to consider. ) The quiz questions and answers are sometimes very cryptic, and some of the course communications aren't always written in proper English. Some of the quiz text appears to be plagiarized from other sources because the content is not covered in readings or lectures. I have printed the quiz out and kept it handy while watching lectures which basically makes it easy to ace most of the questions. The TAs are also sticklers for following the directions, but we had the same issue in CS6300... some people just don't follow directions. I am mostly satisfied, though, because these issues have not gotten in the way of my learning, and I have a pretty decent understanding of Python so the assignments are not that challenging. ",

The lectures have continued to be good, but the rest of the class experience has been a disappointment. I feel for the TAs - it seems like there has been ZERO involvement from the professor of record now that he's moved on to Princeton. The TAs are left holding the bag, and things have been very disorganized as a result. The programming assignments are almost laughably easy (I completed most in less than an hour), but the multiple-choice quizzes take a ridiculous amount of time. A lot of the questions are so incredibly vague or the answers just didn't make any sense - in some cases, there were no correct answers available, which was acknowledged by the TAs on the course forum. My general process for handling the quizzes was to watch the lectures, read any supplemental papers that were linked, read the Piazza forum, watch the office hours... and when all that failed, as it frequently did, Google for the answers. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a 10-question multiple choice quiz can take upwards of 6 or 7 hours to complete. The Piazza forum itself is another issue... it's very frequently difficult to get any sort of 'official' response from a TA to questions. Students are helping each other as much as possible, but it would be nice to get official confirmation for questions that relate to policy/procedures. This is my first semester in the program, and I would have been really disappointed and questioning the caliber of the program if I weren't taking CS6300 concurrently. ",

The material was interesting, and the lectures with the now departed Prof. Feamster were well done, but what #61 said about the quizes was very true and very disappointing. I'm also going to suggest that perhaps the class was too large to be effectively managed, and perhaps 200-300 students should be the max on a course at the graduate level given the time commitments of not only the students, but also the TAs involved. Having more TAs doesn't necessarily solve all issues that arise from such a large class in a variation on the maxim of the mythical man-month. ",

On the positive side, in the first part of the course, the lectures provide a good graduate level introduction to networking. The rest of the course deals mostly with Software Defined Networking. Here, the lectures are ok. But the 'lab' part of the assignments really need to be reworked-they are not challenging and often involved mindlessly following step by step instructions. Also on the negative side, the quizes were poorly written, not particularly challenging and often contained errors. TAs were slow to return quizes and there was a 'negotiation' on piazza after a quiz was graded, and then the quizes were regraded. With some exceptions, Piazza discussions were not great and TA responses were often no more than a couple of words. ",

You had to watch Piazza pretty closely to keep tabs on the various quiz questions for that week. Also, while the quizzes *were* poorly worded and vague (which is unacceptable for any CS class), some students were quite rude to the TAs, who were trying to handle 500 students. I'd echo the sentiments above about the autograder too. GT should provide some automated grading framework like web-cat to handle that load instead of TAs writing custom, fragile auto graders. This way students could validate their code before submitting. I found the lectures very informative, the quizzes at their best made you go learn new things and at their worst confused the heck out of you with vague and imprecise language. I came into the class with zero networking knowledge or Python knowledge and I came out with an A. Don't take it expecting to learn Python. The most complex code you'll write is a loop. I do feel like the lectures were very beneficial though and enjoyed watching them. If they offer this class in the same format again (which I doubt they will), be sure to check Piazza often as there are some pretty funny exchanges between rude students who take themselves a bit too seriously and TAs that are stretched a bit too thin.

They give you an expected solution to match and most of the time, you should be able to reach it. There are quizzes and they do take time to get right. They are not trivial, it requires reading, looking up stuff online and researching to get correctly. Course lectures ARE NOT ENOUGH. While the class is not mathematically intense or technically complex, you get a solid understanding of the concepts and material.

Most of the help you get will be from fellow students, given the size of the class, I'd say you'll bound to find help from good students. The assignments are horribly designed and not well tested before deployment. The quiz questions are ambigous, causing a lot of frustration. The quiz are not difficult at all, Most of the admitted students are smart and will be able to comprehend the material in the video lecture easily. So imagine how they can design the multiple choice questions to test your IQ? They make them very ambiguous so you might just choose the wrong answer even you understand everything they taught just fine. in Fall 2014 80% of the student got an A. No mid term no finals, just 10 easy programming assignments + multiple choice questions. Just brush up on your python programming (you need to be able to read code from framework, you only need to write a few lines for each assignment). A great deal of the frustration you'll get is to understand the python mininet API framework, which is the center piece of every assignment but none of the lecture video cover the framework at all. Use a good editor like pycharm so you can jump to definition of the framework python code. That's all you need. ",

It also gave a whole bunch of extra progamming assignments and exposure to some newer technologies that improve upon Pyretic or expand its capabilities. Overall, the course is far too easy on its own, but the material itself is very interesting and if you dig a little deeper and do some extra work on your own, you can still get just as much out of it as you get out of the more stand-alone challenging courses.

            "text": "This class is both interesting and fun. The lectures aren't too long. So it is fairly easy to keep up. \n\nNot to be confused with High-Performance Computer Architecture.. this class is all about Parallel Algorithms and how to program Super-Computers. You learn the Work/Span model and how to evaluate algorithms for Parallel Computers. You develop Parallel programs and you learn how to use new primitives to solve problems in a parallel manner. You learn how to program with both the Shared Memory and Distributed Memory architectures. There also seems to be a part about Cache Oblivious algorithms at the end (though we haven't gotten to that yet). \n\nOn the negative side though, there are topics that should be covered in lectures but aren't so you'll have to learn them on your own from arcane papers. The course organization could be improved a bit so that we aren't jumping from topic to topic. \n\nIf you aren't familiar with the subject matter then it will take some iterations to understand it. I went through the lectures 3x. \n\nThe labs require a LOT of time. Best start them early. The code is in C and C++ with OpenMP and OpenMPI. The main issue is just getting the code to work in the first place so you can then plan with the parallel part. \n\nThe TAs seem inexperienced and are mostly absent unfortunately. The professor is very engaged and answers a lot of questions on Piazza. The lectures are fun and funny to watch. \n\nIts highly doubtful I'll get an A in this class and a B will only be possible if I improve (I've gotten an A in every other class I've taken in the program).

There is a lot of studying of outside sources, not just the recommended readings, but whatever you can find on the algorithms you need to implement. They're not at all easy and you get very little credit for implementing them correctly. You'll spend a great deal of time just getting correct code, but you're graded mostly on performance, so keep that in mind. You need to pass the Udacity grader early, so you have plenty of time left to optimize and test your performance on the cluster. \n\nYou absolutely need to already know C, C++, and ideally at least a little about how OpenMP and OpenMPI work, or it's just going to get worse trying to learn that as you go. Know how to use common debugging and program analysis tools as well, gdb, valgrind, etc. You'll spend most of your time debugging early on when you're just trying to make sure the code works. \n\nFinally, know that it's not at all impossible to do well. I had trouble and had to drop because I was taking two other classes at the same time (including ML, which has very in-depth assignments) and was going through personal difficulties and just didn't have the time for it. If I had the time, I'm sure I'd have done fine. Just don't take the class lightly. You need to get an early start on every lab, do all the readings plus whatever other readings you can find, and get your code working early. I wish I'd known ahead of time we'd get almost nothing for correctness and be graded mostly on performance, which I guess makes sense in retrospect, but just wasn't what I was expecting based on all the other courses I've taken.

The projects are definitely difficult as I spend most of my time just trying to get the algorithm working without consideration for efficiency, but so far I have done well.

The lectures are well laid out and I was able to watch them at 1. 25x or 1. 5x the speed, depending on whether or not Milos had his coffee before he recorded the session. I enjoyed the coding sessions and I think that the changes we were required to make are close to what you might see in the real world if you were modifying internal simulation software. The most difficult aspect is that there is little guidance as to whether or not the metrics that you find in your projects are the optimal solution. This simulates the real world, where you have to make sure that what you code isn't outputting crap numbers, but makes it difficult to ensure that you get a good grade on every assignment, especially those where you are competing against the other students. Not for the feignt of heart, but a good class full of pretty cool information. ",

You should have encountered MIPS assembly language for the discussions, but you won't need to do any MIPS programming - you just need to understand what the arguments and commands look like and you should be able to pick it up from there. The four assignments (2 individual, 2 with optional partners) will require C++ knowledge, and a VM environment to run the linux VM that contains the simulator (VMWare is recommended). \nI think the class started with something like 160 students, and at last count had around 100 on the roster; although the professor indicated something like 50-60 students turned in the latest assignment, so maybe quite a few more have dropped.

Poor responsiveness on Piazza, with a week or more going by without any instructor or TA presence. Absurd grading... one assignment had us submit (among other things) a 'Hello World' program with a modification to include our name. I forgot to submit that one (partly because the way the assignments are written makes it tricky to pull out what's needed for a submission) and got docked 30% of the whole grade. The course makes use of the SESC simulator, which is one of the worst, most poorly documented codebases I've ever seen. In addition, the effort required to work with SESC and modify it was vastly out of proportion to what we were studying. I never understood how wading through SESC to figure out how to change the branch predictor had any relevance to what a real processor does. Finally, the exams were a disaster. They used ProctorTrack for the test, but it was basically open book in that you could use any printed or written references, but couldn't use anything on your computer. You had to do everything by hand on paper (like when doing the incredibly tedious cycle counting problems). This was a real problem in the test, because I hadn't done them that way... I always worked in OneNote to set up my tables, plug in my steps, etc. When I had to do it on paper on my desk, it was a complete mess. ",

For example our group worked very well, but many others complained in the forums about issues they were having where some team members were dead weight. Because of this your experience can vary greatly. You definetly need to know some Java going into this class. My knowledge was limmited to one class I took several years back, but was able to catch up quick by taking other online tutorials and READING BOOKs as I went and I Googled ALOT! The last project (originally scheduled to be a group project but changed after complaints about groups) was a solo project and very large. My project ended up being over 500 lines of code.

The material explored many topics but none of them in-depth, in some cases were just basic tutorials for tools like git and Eclipse. The assignments felt more like jumping through hoops rather than being challenged to think critically and be creative. Overall the course felt disorganized and vague, most of the time I was not confident that I actually understood what was required and had to read a lot of forum posts for clarification, even on extremely simple busy work assignments. The most effort in the course is required during the group projects, which can include students anywhere on a spectrum from not being able to write code at all to having 10+ years of Java experience. A lot of groups had problems and partially due to that the last group project was changed to a solo project at the last minute. I think I would only recommend this course to beginners who are confident that they can write Java code but do not have much software development experience beyond that. If you know absolutely nothing about concepts like source control, test coverage, and UML then you will learn a lot. If you already have a lot of experience in software development and want to explore software engineering concepts higher than a very basic level, this course is not for you. ",

I say this because some people complained about the content of the class. If you don't have prior experience with software development and Java programming, you may need to spend a lot more time. Also, there was an Android project which I think it wasn't too bad but some people complianed about the need to learn a lot of things in a short period of time.

Students should have to pass some coding pre-reqs to take this course because unprepared students are a huge burden on teammates; 'just' working on documents is no panacea because if they aren't involved with or don't understand the difficulty of implementing requirements, it hurts the entire team. There is zero involvement from TAs in managing group conflict, and no real authority structure to groups.

We spent a lot of time together, which was the hardest part, but we worked well together and I learned a lot about group work. Some weeks I spent very little time in this class.

Lectures were interesting, and assignments/projects did a decent job of letting students practice the development process concepts we were learning about. I came in to this class with 6 or 7 years of. NET development experience, but no Java/Android experience. I had to spend a little extra time on the assignments to transition my. NET knowledge over to Java, but it was easy to do so and the assignments are relatively basic. I would think that someone with zero programming experience would want to take a quick intro before jumping in, though. There were two group projects in this iteration of the class, which I'm normally not a fan of but they complemented this class nicely. Good simulation of working as part of a team in the real world. I felt like the way they handled grading the team vs. individual contributions was fair. I had a great group that had no problems working together, so I'm not sure how any serious conflicts within the team would be handled if the professor/TAs had to be involved. ",

I had a great experience with my group however I am aware that this was not the case universally. GATech make an effort to place at least one experienced Java dev in each group so even if you are not particularly strong in programming, you can fill another role in the group such as testing and/or documentation. There are individual programming assignments as well however these are considerably easier than the group projects. The overall progression of the assignments simulated a typical system development lifecycle project (with a RAD twist) with all the associated deliverables; systems requirements doc, prototype, test case doc, UML model, user manual, etc. I found that it was possible to deliver the assignments without really watching the lectures however part of your grade is based on your completion of the udacity quizzes so I guess this encourages you to watch all the lectures.

The course instructor was one of the most engaging though which made it an alright experience.

I understand it's trying to represent 'real-world' work where you have to collaborate with a team, but in the real world you don't have people with so little programming experience who are still gainfully employed, and quite frankly the 'project-manager' role for the project doesn't have an equitable share of the work.

The projects (45% of the grade) were physics-focused and we had to spend a lot of time dealing with those aspects of the project, which distracted from time to focus on the software architecture. The final exam covers the entire course, so do yourself a favor and prepare study questions as you go so you don't have to re-review and cram the week before finals!

The instructor expects perfect papers, yet his course material is riddled with errors. There is even a dedicated place on the class forums to report these 'bugs. ' The only positive aspect of this is that it counts for class participation. I found many of the problems I reported just by copying the instructions and doing a spell check in Word. I know of 2 students who dropped other courses and one who withdrew from school because of this class. If you take it, be ready for a roller coaster ride. I never realized how much stress and anxiety can produce physical symptoms until I went to the doctor and she said I was likely experiencing a rapid heart beat and night sweats because of this class. The best thing about the whole experience is that now I have a profound respect for those people who deal with panic attacks on a daily basis. Worst class I've ever taken.

First, there should be fewer assignments, they should be shorter, and they should be individual. I say this because I know a limiting factor is the workload on the graders, so some combination of fewer/shorter assignments can result in them grading the same number of pages as they do with the current set-up. Second, the projects need to be set up in a way that recognizes teams do not meet in person, and that teams are comprised of a wider variety of CS backgrounds than one would find on the on-campus program. People without programming experience can't contribute to the code, nor can they contribute much to documents that require understanding of the code. Third, the administration of the final exam has been a disaster. More than a few lucky students have been allowed up to three hours to take the test by their proctors, while others given only 60 minutes. To do well in the course, you must have some lucky combination of getting assigned to the right project teams, getting assigned to a lax grader, and getting a proctor who gives you far more than the allotted time for the final exam.

Thankfully, on each team I was on there was always a physics guy, which was invaluable. The assignments can easily be done on your own, but I believe the group requirement for the assignments was to make things easier on the markers. Coordinating a group on the assignments was trivial; however coordinating the group for the projects was decidedly more difficult. I had two great teams, and one bad team, but I wouldn't use that as a reason to get rid of the group work. I found the group work a great way to meet other people in the OMSCS program. The course web site states that you need to know how to program, and that there will be group work. A few small tweaks, and this course will be awesome. This course is a lot of work, but I wouldn't steer clear of it. ",

Too much emphasis on figuring out Physics-related requirements takes focus away from the project purpose of learning about Software Arch and Design. About 10% of project work was directly related to what we learnt in course. Rest of completely irrelevant. I thought the assignments were good. They reinforced things learnt in lectures. But they team based and that should not be the case. They are small enough for individual work. Plus the learing would be better if the entire assignment was done by a single person. Currently, sections of assignments are split up and you rarely get a full view of the topic at hand. Projects should be cut down in scope and grading emphasis should shift a bit more towards assignments. \nSince I had teammates who were in my timezone or in the zones at max 3 hours away, coordination wasnt really an issue. I am glad projects were team based since that is one way to meet other people in the course and learn from them. \nThe course has some great content like design patterns, design pricipiles and architectural styles. However, first section focuses on UML/OCL and pretty much everyone who had sw dev experience said that it is not very practical. We spent a lot of time on that in the course and during projects and it feels like a waste of time. Instead, if the lectures focuesd more on the other three topics I mentioned and go in depth about them, it will be useful. Some of the lectures on these topic were just 'read-a-list-from-telepromptor' type and that was really disappinting. \nWith some modifications, this can be a great course. ",

There was also no real motivation to read all the suggested extra material. We were never tested on any of it. \n\n2) TEXT BOOK : I purchased the 'text BOOK ', which the professor DOES say is optional. It was VERY overpriced ($79. 95, even though the professor mistakenly says that students will be able to get the discounted price of $64. 95, which is STILL overpriced). For the price, it’s closer to the size of a PAMPHLET than a text BOOK !! I was very shocked when it came in the mail!\n\nDespite being overpriced, the lectures ARE based on the book content, so the book does indeed provide a solid foundation to the videos. It helped me a LITTLE with the midterm, but after the unfair/ambiguous/subjective questions on the midterm I probably would have done fine without the BOOK. \n\nDespite these kinks, I will say that Prof. Mark and TA Shan are very knowledgeable and responsive to concerns.

Originally the course material stated that groups could use any web platform/framework/programming language, then after many groups formed around experience with particular technologies it was announced that all groups needed to use Java/Tomcat in order to deploy to particular machines at Georgia Tech that have access to the proprietary health data. The final deployment machines and data are not accessible to students during development, and at the end of the semester students will submit their completed WAR app which will be run on the machines with the full data for the first time without giving students the opportunity to fix any bugs or issues related to deployment and using the new data. Other than those issues (which my group avoided by requesting and being granted approval to use our own servers and data) the project is a straight-forward web application group project. Groups are required to use the health data in some way but aside from that the project is very open-ended in terms of what students can focus on for their app. As with any OMSCS group project, the previous experience of students varies greatly within the class, with some students having almost no web development experience on one end of the spectrum and some having worked in the industry for 10+ years on the other end. The groups are self-selected rather than assigned by the instructors so the overall experience level of the groups can vary as well. The instructors are active on Piazza with regular announcement posts and answers to questions from students, although sometimes basic details of assignments such as length or format of presentations are announced close to the deadline. For students with no web development or Java experience at all, I would suggest learning some basic skills before taking this course, and the CS 6300 course in the OMSCS program is the closest in terms of an intro to those sorts of development skills. Otherwise any student should be able to succeed in this course and I recommend it to anyone who has interest in the topics. ",

Although the prof. often writes somewhat strange/debatable mutliple choice questions, the quizzes are generally easy if you watched the corresponding lectures recently. The project was open-ended (and initially somewhat undefined) and we were tasked with forming our own teams. The projects are either web or mobile apps so it's important that some of your team members have those skills. Upfront work identifying a good team and project will result in a smooth semester. ",

The quizes questions for the most part were not very difficult if you paid attention to the lectures and used common sense; however, some of the questions were ambiguous at best and others downright confusing. \n\nWhat I found to be the most disappointing was the group project. Spring 2015 was the first semester they tried to use the GT FHIR server and it did not go well. Between the server constantly being under development, server connectivity problems, VPN problems, and a whole lot of other issues the project was a real pain for many groups. Our group decided fairly early on to abandon the GT FHIR server in favor of the more stable, public SPARK FHIR server and that turned out to be a good idea looking back on all the issues other groups were having. I felt our issues that we had to work through with our chosen server were relatively minor in comparison. \n\nGroup selection was an annoying issue with the course too. It look a couple weeks for everyone to find a group to join. The group I formed had a couple people express interest in joining only to find out they were apparently 'shopping' for the best group. The TAs sent out multiple requests trying to find groups for people to join as well. Also we didn't get to peer review our group members which was disappointing. The reason I say this class is Somewhat Easy is because the issues with the group project made it harder than it should have been. ",

The class could be run a bit better, but it is not all bad. I see lots of interaction on Piazza between the students and the TA's. Also, the professor does pop in the forum from time to time. I think the problems this class is experiencing stem from the fact that the prof is trying to keep the class up to date, so there is some churn in the material. Not a bad class at all. Assignments are spread out over the semester, so some weeks there is nothing to do (well, we are supposed to be working on our project). When there is an assigment, reading or otherwise takes a few hours in addition to the quizzes. This semester, we had one (1) try at taking each quiz. You do have to think/know the material to get it right.

The course is an exploration of education technology in whichever direction you wish to go in the space.

The course has a number of short essays due weekly that step you through the process of identifying an area of interest, reviewing existing research, and scoping a research project or development tool project for the remainder of the semester. The project is formalized with a Proposal that includes weekly milestones and some progress deliverables prior to the final completed project. Along the way, your progress is monitored by a single 'mentor' (TA) that is there to answer questions and ensure that your are on track, scoped correctly, etc. An important component of the class is participation, which includes giving and getting peer feedback along the way with each of the essays. The students are encouraged to participate in daily discussions on Piazza which follow a weekly pattern... 'What did you learn?', 'Q&A with ??', 'Let's discuss +/- of an existing OMS course', etc. The instructor is Dr. David Joyner, of KBAI fame, and he is extremely active on Piazza, keeping the class lively and engaged, which is no mean feat since we are all doing different projects. The final coursework is not done, so I can't comment here how it will all end, but so far it is a joy to be part of this particular environment. It is different from other courses.

The course started with an example that bordered on a magic trick, which definitely set the stage for it to be an engaging semester. The workload is moderate and consistent. There is ample room to go above and beyond on the projects if you have extra time, but you can usually squeak by on them without losing too much sleep.

It is paced appropriately, with small, meaningful assignments each week that correlate directly to the lessons and can be accomplished during the week over over a weekend. Very -- very -- detailed explanations of assignment rubric, comments and the autograder, and judicious flexibility when there is an error in the assignment writeup, opting in favor of the students. Unlike other courses, I was not left in doubt about what was expected for each assignment. Essa and the current TA (Daniel Castro) are both obviously interested in the material and encourage active Piazza discussion. The assignments test core material, but allow significant flexibility in the kinds of images chosen and always offer a section for explaining (inevitable) failures. Nothing but positive things to say about this course. PeerFeedback (. gatech. edu) is used well. I am both learning a lot and enjoying the class, which is about as good as you can get. ",

Since they want you to use your own pics, it invests me with more interest in the assignments. I think the assignments have been very clear, and really not that hard conceptually. Paying attention to what is asked and answered on piazza helps. This is the first time I ever coded in python, that cost me hours of learning the syntax. OpenCV has reasonable documentation, but it might not all apply to your version. So fun at 2am. It's really opened my eyes to what is possible with computers. we are writing our own code, or using open source, and it has generally had impressive results. Class piazza tips and help has been invaluable, and people have seemed to hit the right balance between enough help to move on, but not give away too much. reading the suggested papers has provided the answers to how to progress more than once. This has been a great intro to the program, fun to be challenged again. ",

The instructor and TAs are awesome in conveying the material and responding to questions on the forums, though sadly, it appears that our current instructor Professor Bobick will no longer be actively in the forums in future semesters since he has accepted a new position. Grade is based on projects and a final exam. Projects are done in Python, MATLAB, or Octave, (your choice) so be sure you have a good handle on one of them (preferably not Octave, since you get MATLAB for free in Georgia Tech). An important thing in this class (and in any other) is to set enough time to watch the lectures and read the materials and do the homework. I've learned many times during this semester that I always need to take some breaks in order to 'get it' and go forward to the next step of the problem. So yeah, if you put aside the time, I think you should be fine. There is also a good amount of linear algebra, but I reckon it shouldn't be an issue if you've taken an undergraduate linear algebra/discrete mathematics course. ",

I have a minor exposure to linear algebra, and a strong exposure to calculus and I still found most of the math over my head. Some things that would be good to know ahead mathmatically: eigenvalues, gradients, sum of square differences, minor exposure to supervised and unsupervised machine learning, physic in motion and illumination, signal and frequencies, and of course the basic matrices and vector operations. The problem sets are the core of your grade and will vary in time commitment. I found ps1, ps4, ps5, ps6 to be the most time consuming having to work over 20 hours on each. The problem sets focused on creating the algorithms for the computation as well as modifying them to optimize your results, so it could get frustrating tweeking the inputs and variable of your algorithms. The professor of the lectures definitely knows his stuff when it comes to CV and a bit of his personality made the lectures very enganging. It's important to take notes for the lectures because at the end of the course there will be an exam and it is a pain have to go back through all the lectures as it was for me. The exam seemed fair. The instructor and TAs are helpful on piazza. And of course other students were very helpful. The office hours were helpful as well, I only had one problem with an office hour where I was the only student there and the TA was very unresponsive, but that was the exception to the rule. Take this course if you want to become interested in Computer Vision because you will once you take this course. The only thing I wish they had done for this course was post solutions to the problem sets after the deadlines. ",

You learn many different concepts of knowledge representation, problem solving, and machine learning. In the first project, you learn how to write a program to solve basic IQ test style questions. However, there are 4 projects in the class, and each project is just the same project, just with harder IQ questions. Grading is completely results based (how many did it solve?), so in the interest of solving as many problems as I could, I have not delved deep into the advanced concepts that we have learned in lecture, because if you're even somewhat busy, you're just going to apply the concepts that will solve the most problems in the least amount of time it takes to write (instead of spending the time to apply as many concepts as it takes to solve all the problems). I would much rather have the class have slightly smaller projects that are different each time (like the problems covered in the lectures are way more interesting to me) more specialized toward a concept that forces you to apply new concepts. Another problem I have with this class is the sheer amount of writing we have to do. I've never taken an engineering class where we literally have to write a paper every week. The amount of writing isn't much, but as someone who has gotten used to writing only for project reports, it really sucks. ",

Also, on the weeks that a midterm or a project isn't due, you have to write mini papers on how you would apply one of the many techniques to the project. Just be sure to keep up with lectures the best you can, stay involved in the class and don't procrastinate. In the early weeks, I think I spent more time on my agent just because I was a bit unsure but there have been weeks that I spent 5 hours on the class. Some of the lectures are an hour long so I'd dedicate at least 10 hours/week to the class, preferably closer to 15 just in case. ",

I'd venture that you could put in much less work and still do well. The programming projects are interesting, but become repetitive. As alluded to above, if you have some algorithmic development under your belt, you can do better than average without even thinking about a KBAI algorithm. There was a *ton* of writing for the class. I think I will hit 80 pages of turned in essays/design reports/exams. This semester there were 5 1000 word essays, 4 1500 word design reports, and 2 ~2500 word exams. However, I think you'd be hard pressed to cover the questions in the depth required by the rubric at those lengths; I was usually at least double the suggested length.

It also means that you get great feedback through the peer review system, and timely assignment grades (which was a problem in my other course). They work to stagger due dates and they publish all due dates at or near the beginning of the term (in the initial syllabus, in fact), which makes it possible for you to plan well if you have other classes or major work commitments. \nIn terms of learning, you get out of the class more or less what you put into it. I didn't have time to implement the number of alternative algorithms I really wanted to on the projects (particularly the later ones), but that wasn't necessary to get a decent grade. \nIn terms of the subject matter, I loved what the course covered, but I am biased since AI is my area of particular interest. I felt that coding the agent was fun but that students without some prior exposure to image processing datastructures were at a disadvantage. \nYou will find this class easy if you: are efficient and good at expressing ideas in writing, are fluent at coding in Java or Python, and have sat in on an image processing course at some point in time (it's fine if you think you've forgotten everything). \nIf one of those doesn't hold true for you, expect to put in a bit more time than my estimate.

I'll list the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Excellent TA and instructors, obviously cared about the class, very very involved in Piazza, and excellent to talk to. \n2. Easy A. Projects are not that hard if you're confident in programming, and are really easy in terms of grading. Last two projects had means in the 60s(which is also the threshold for an A), and I ended with grades in the high 80s with a couple of hours of effort. \n\nCons:\n1. Way too many things. I don't really understand why you need 4 projects, 5 assignments, a midterm and a final?? Oh wait and also peer feedback/participation. I spent way too much time on this class for nowhere close to enough gain. \n2. Grading is a joke. \n a. Project grading is virtually completely based on how many problems your agent solves, which de-incentivzes you to try anything creative. \n b. Assignment/midterm/final grading is absurd. I did well on them all, but it seems to completely arbitrary. I would get a below mean grade on an assignment with a comment 'Good job', or points docked off with no explanation, or a really good score on an obviously half-assed assignment. \n3. Peer feedback is quite useless. Started off well for maybe one assignment, after which point it became obvious that people were just doing it to get your participation grade, and not really reading the assignments. Not to mention they made it compulsory to do peer feedback for assignments that you didn't even attempt. \n4. Content is useless. Ah, this was my biggest gripe with this course. The material taught in the class did not seem practical at all. Maybe I'm amazingly misunderstanding the course material, but it seems to be mostly common sense that they somehow manage to come up with more and more terminology for. And I don't mean trying to understand how common sense works, no, I mean the concepts that they understand seemed hardly worthy of a class. If you look at any practical AI, it's machine learning and mathematical approaches. I think I learned absolutely nothing in this class. \n5. Projects are unrelated to course content. I got excellent grades on all the projects, but I saw basically no relation to the content taught in the class. I would have done equally well had I not watched a single video(except for the project report, where I had to shoehorn concepts to the actual project)",

There is a lot of communication between students and teachers which keeps you engaged in the class.

The test format is like any other college test, but they are hard - you probably cannot get the right answers by intuition during the test, even if you are very familiar with the topics; the answers tend to require reasoning abstractly under time pressure (although less time pressure on the final).

The assignments are flexible in terms of content, and very time-consuming, but the skills you will need to complete them can be learned during the course (you don't, for example, need to be a great programmer). The time-consuming aspect is usually learning how to do techniques needed for the assignment in Weka or another program, then actually running all of the experiments and collecting the data, before you can even start writing the 10+ page paper. If you try to procrastinate and wait until the last few days to start an assignment, you will not do well in this course. The exams are tough but fair, if you remember and understand everything from the lessons you should be able to answer everything without getting stuck, although the midterm was purpsosely designed to not give you enough time to complete it so don't waste too much time on any given question. I would say the one downside of this course is that it will take up too much time if you have commitments outside of this program and are taking another time-consuming course.

I really enjoyed the lectures and actually watched the rest of the lectures before dropping the course as I found the material really interesting. The time commitment comes from the papers you have to write. You dont actually write any machine learning algorithms. You download prepackaged algorithms, run them on non-trivial datasets and write papers comparing their performance and drawing conclusions. It requires a lot of knowledge in math (stats, etc) and just took way too much time. I took the midterm before dropping and did pretty well. I felt the midterm was extremely fair. But those papers, it will consume all your time. ",

If you're the type of person that prefers paint-by-numbers type of assignments this class isn't for you. It is very open-ended and self-directed. The biggest challenge of the assignments is figuring out what to do as opposed to actually doing it. The lectures are great, but expect to supplement them heavily with the text BOOK and online research. Downsides: the instructor support in the forum was a bit scarce and/or untimely and the assignment grading was likewise untimely with limited feedback as the grading is based on a rigid rubric (which is hidden from you) that probably isn't ideal for such open-ended assignments. Also, the class felt very front-loaded to me as the last third was pretty quiet compared to the earlier enjoyable hell. The RL mini course doesn't tie in very well with the SL/UL stuff. ",

This included the MIT 7. 00x: Introduction to Biology and 7. QBWx Quantitative Biology Workshop. Prof. Isbell was active on Piazza answering all types of questions which I think is rare. So thank you for that. Though I do have some complaints listed below this is still the best OMSCS class I have taken so far. I expect to get kicked in the teeth for me to respect the class. I want to take the reinforcement learning class when it comes out though I will prepare for it in advance. \n\nBad - Will consume all time so don't take this course with another course. Some problem sets were assigned but solutions posted were incomplete. General lack of concrete problem examples/solutions. Needed to pull from old tests from other universities. \n\nUgly - Inconsistant grading of projects. Some received feedback of points off based on a rubric, some got only comments without telling where points where deducted and some got nothing at all. Felt some graders were tougher then others as I could tell several different grading styles. Either I had an easy grader for my third project or I got someone else's grade as it was my worst paper of the four but my highest grade. This will get worse as they may go to no feedback at all as the class size scales. You won't even know if your score is your own or a mistake. I think a few sentences describing where you got points deducted is a minimum requirement for a distance learning program for major assignments. ",

Exams were mostly about 'synthesis', i. e. , demonstrating your knowledge/recall of the material through writing. reading all of the readings was very helpful for exams, but very time-consuming as well.

Looking things up that you know are on a video is hard to do, though.

Its a fine strategy, and it does force the students to learn themselves with effort. As to the assignments, there were parts of them that I really enjoyed, but mostly they were just a lot of work to do. The parts that I enjoyed were where I had a flash of inspiration and was able to come up with applciations of the problems to solve things that I found cool, but without those flashes just meant that you are spending hours and hours thinking about random datasets that aren't really that exciting. The assignments are very open ended, and they basically just say 'Answer all of the questions that you can think of about [something]', but do note that there are specific requirements that you are graded against, you just don't get to see them in advance. This didn't impact me very much, but I know that others were annoyed that they lost points for something that wasn't specifically called out as a requirement. The TAs went through bursts of being responsive, but then we wouldnt hear much for weeks. Oh, and the peer review system that they set up was worthless. They said it was optional, but then mandated that you could only get answers from TAs about your grading through the peer review system (so much for optional), and the peer feedback came too late to help with anything.

As such you're pretty much have to try to answer as many questions as you can as concisely as you can. The exams focus heavily on ideas and concepts, but this does not mean the material is light on the details! In order to perform well I believe you will have to understand the material in some depth. \n\nOn the assignments, they are a huge time sink, and I would recommend choosing the smallest possible problem to answer. Be prepared to run through assignments multiple times to contribute very little to your actual assignment writing. On the tooling side, I ended up using R, Python, Java and MATLAB. I would say the best idea is to be comfortable on many different platforms, and pick the one which you feel will solve the problem the easiest. It is a matter of choosing the best tool for the situation. With that in mind I think that it is essential to at least know a little bit of Java for assignment 2 using the ABAGAIL library, since MIMIC algorithm is not really implemented anywhere else. (MIMIC is based on an algorithm which is the subject of Charles' research). Be prepared for learning curve on the tools that you will use, because at least for me I ended up trying many different tools for my assignments, before settling on one. \n\nOverall, I have enjoyed the course and have learnt a lot.

(In retrospect I would go with making easier problems rather than flashier, more intricate problems). Basically, this was an excellent way to learn how to implement a machine learning problem in the practical sense. If the assignments are the practical side of ML, then the exams were the thereotical side. The midterm was hard, I couldn't even finish the whole test, this is expected so it is generously curved, they are also very lenient with grading it, so move fast on the midterm. I just finished the final and didn't find it to be as difficult as the midterm. I enjoyed both tests. And although the implementations of the algorithms were not required to be done for the course, the algorithms were given in class and left to the student to implement himself if he wanted to. I was not too fond of this at first, but realized that I learned more about the behavior of data and machine learning algorithms by seeing how they worked in a practical sense. If one wants to learn more indepth about how algorithms should be implemented look at the Coursera. com course on Machine Learning, which I also highly recommend. I am excited for the new reinforcement course taught by the same professors in the Fall. Its good to know Java and Python for this class. As I am sure the TA were quite backed up this semester, I was not happy with the grading system. Points on assignments seem to be taken off without much justification. ",

The lectures take so long to get to the point, they are quite shallow and we never see an application of the algorithms (I thought it was a strong point of the Andrew Ng's lectures). The assignments are painfully long and the grading is so frustratingly inconsistent. Most of the time a assignment requires to solve twice the same problem for no other reason than to take up your time. There is so much material covered that we learn everything to a very shallow level and the math that everybody seems to be scared about is never used during the assignments nor during the exams (which makes the math requirements quite low I think). This being said, I have learned so much during this class and that makes a very effective foundational class for the rest of the master. If the Machine learning specialization is the one you want, start by this class! I would even add that I would not have succeeded in the interview process I just went through without this class experience. ",

Note that these required virtually no coding. They encourage you to do as little coding as possible for the assignments, and they are serious about this. Unfortunately, they had very specific grading criteria which they didn't share in advance of the assignment submission, particularly for the first one.

This includes brainstorming ideas, programming and implementation of algorithms, collecting data, generating graphs and tables, and writing the report. I admit that I'm a pretty slow (bad?) coder, but using Python made it easier. On the other hand, Python has fewer resources and is slower than Java. But that's the practical lesson of the homeworks: balancing speed of implemention, execution time, and effectiveness. Don't make your homework needlessly complicated though, since your goal should be to master the concepts, not programming!\n\nThe recommended book (by Tom Mitchell) was pretty accessible. It's not a criticism of the class, but I thought many of the examples IN THE book were lame or otherwise uninteresting. On the other hand, the chapter introductions and especially summaries were a great review. I would recommend also checking out a few other BOOK s in addition. \n\nLast comment: Piazza is awesome, especially if you are active. I didn't find Hipchat to be very useful since it was a bit too real-time and you couldn't typeset math when you needed to explain equations or what not. I didn't attend any of the office hours. ",

I felt that this course was a bit too open-ended at times. \n\nThe lectures are entertaining and informative. \n\nThe assignments are based around performing a series of expiriments and then performing analysis on those expiriments. Neither the lectures nor the assignment instructions go into any real discussion on how to implement the expiriments, you are mostly on your own in that regard. You need to choose what tool or software package to use (WEKA, ABAGAIL, BURLAP, R, SciKit, etc. ) as well as what algorithms and parameters to use in many cases. You are given very little direction on how to perform the expiriments, so they typically take a great deal of time to setup. You are given zero points for implementing the actual expiriment, the grade is based entirely on your analysis of your results. That said, as long as you answer all the questions the assignment poses, the grading tended to be fair. Piazza is your friend here as other students are a good source for what direction to go or not to go for each assignment. \n\nThe exams were also very open-ended and you aren't given much direction on what to study. \n\nOverall if you do all of the assignments, and do more than just watch the lectures and read the book to study you should manage at least a B.

The structure of the material presentation is what I consider as best - starting with the main idea(s) and presenting it in a simple (but not primitive) and memorable way and then diving into details (technical and rigourous) and then recaping what you've learnt. The level is very good and assignments allow you to make the course as difficult as you want. Some suggestions: To students - 1) follow the assignment rubric carefully, if it says do kurtosis analysis - do it (it's actually not that optional as you might think). If you do a reasonable analysis following rubric fully, you can be almost sure you'll get more than 90% and all the rest will depend on the amount and quality of your analysis. 2) Do all optional work you are given (reviewing assignments, problem sets, etc. ) It will help understand the material and get a better grade. 3) If you want to really succeed on the exams (like solving almost all problems) and it is your 1st ML course, then doing lectures and homework assignments most probably won't be enough. Read the BOOK s and solve some additional problems from other sources. To Profs: 1) it would be great to make problem sets a little closer to the type of questions students will see on the exam (both questions and problems), I felt that they were slightly disconnected sometimes. 2) It would be better to provide more problems in each problem set (even if they are optional). 3) It would be good to see not only midterm exam explained by Profs, but also Final - it is a really important educational piece to know what you did right/wrong on the exam and why.

Some of the advanced math concepts for the algorithms were challenging, but not essential to understanding how to use the algorithms. The class was very rewarding and I recommend it, but you should plan sufficient time to keep up with the workload. If you fall behind, you would have a difficult time recovering. One other thing that is crucial to the class is the selection of datasets you use for your assignments. Picking a simple dataset won't let you contrast the algorithms, picking too large a dataset will make run-times for the projects extremely long. My recommendation is to find a good large dataset and pair the data down to something that runs in a reasonable time. Don't use small datasets with less than 1000 records. ",

The difficulty of this course is it covers a ton of material. It mostly glosses over regression and doesn't address generalized linear models at all, nor does it go into any kind of graph analytics. There is exactly zero discussion of tools and applications. What you get is the kitchen sink of techniques for taking in data and gaining some understanding of it, as well as optimization and optimal control thrown in for good measure. \n\nThe treatment of the math is frankly fairly superficial if you have a decent working intuition of probability and linear algebra. There isn't much discussion of statistics and it would help to supplement what you get here with some outside reading about resampling, bootstrapping, cross-validation, and various loss functions. You need these to analyze the results you get. You don't need to get deep in the weeds with proofs, but understand how and why they work and what you're measuring. \n\nThe biggest thing is don't underestimate the assignments. Don't get cute trying to build web scrapers or pull real-time data from APIs, doing all kinds of feature engineering. Being a data ninja is fun, but this isn't the class for it. You'll get zero extra credit for that. Pick something from the UCI repository that is ready to throw into a train function right away. 100% of the points you get are your analysis. Use well-tested library code on simple datasets and put your effort into visualizing and explaining the performance characteristics of each algorithm, because you need to run quite a few of them. Know what a complexity curve is, a learning curve, a confusion matrix, know what the tuning parameters are for each modeling package and know how and why performance changes when you tweak them. And know the performance measures! Be prepared to explain why you would use accuracy, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, or whatever measure you use. It's specific to the problem you're trying to solve and this isn't covered in lectures or in the required text, so do some outside study. The package documentation for modeling software usually explains these things pretty well and it isn't complicated, but you'll lose points if you just use straight defaults across the board and can't justify why you chose the resampling technique, parameter tuning strategy, and performance measures you chose.

I was hoping for more coverage of times series analysis and how to deal with non-IID samples, fat tails, heteroskedasticity, etc. , since we seem to just assume IID and approximately normal in developing ideas in the base ML course, but I guess this is a CS program, not a math or econ program. The other issue here is they're revamping the assignments on the go from what they used to be in the Coursera course, presumably to make them more challenging for grad students qualified to study at Georgia Tech, rather than the 10, 000 who used to take the course for free every few months, but they're not releasing them on-time and we've ended up with a great deal of dead time between finishing something and having nothing else to work on.

This course has less of a heavy workload than many of the other courses, especially early on before the Runaway Robot and Final Project parts. Part of that is due to how streamlined the assignments are, the coding is built into the Udacity interface so you just write code and submit it like a normal quiz answer. I much prefer this method over the methods used in some of the other courses where you have to setup your own environment locally and worry about packaging everything up for graders to be able to reproduce it on their side. I spent a very long time on the final optional Runaway Robot part and completing it felt like a big accomplishment even though it was autograded like every other coding assignment, so just because there is an autograder doesn't mean all of the assignments are easy. The Final Project is extremely open-ended and lets you explore whatever topics from the course interest you and apply it to any domain. I really enjoyed that flexibility because I could choose a topic and project that I found interesting and wanted to put a lot of time into. You will need to write Python code for all of the assignments but as long as you have some programming experience you should be okay, if you find yourself lost early on you can probably learn Python from other resources online as you are taking this course. Overall I highly recommend this course, especially if you are taking another course with a heavy workload and want an interesting course that you will learn a lot from that is more flexible on time.

The lectures are structured to take full advantage of the Udactity integrated python enviroment. This makes it easy to make incremental advances in your understanding of the topics. I wish they covered a few more ways to apply the different types of filters. Each filter is explained in a particular context and without experience in the field it's difficult to see how it could be applied in another situation.

Professor Thrun is very entertaining and holds regular office hours to answer student questions in a Q&A format. You do not need the book at all for this course! I purchased it thinking I would reference it, but only cracked it open once or twice and would not buy it again. The only criticisms I would make are that the assignments make use of a custom Matrix() class, whereas students could probably get a little extra Python learning in if the assignments used numpy. Also, with the exception of the Runaway Robot Project #5, the class is almost a little too easy. I hate to use that word because the concepts are pretty advanced, but the assignments are more or less spoon fed to some degree. Overall, I highly, highly recommend taking this course and recommend that other instructors use this course as a template when designing new courses!\n\nEDIT: While I still highly recommend this course, I wanted to make a note of the grading policy. There are 6 lectures, each of which has some programming assignments associated with it. The total points for all assignments is worth 24% of the class grade, without any partial credit per week. The runaway robot project is worth 36% of the class grade, with up to a 12% extra credit opportuniy for finishing part 5. Part 5 was pretty difficult (Professor Thrun admitted to giving up on it) and less than 10 students to my knowledge finished it. The final project is worth a whopping 40% of the class grade and is very open ended with minimal opportunity for extra credit (3 teams total). To me it seems that the final is worth a little too much and the weekly assignments are not worth quite as much as they should be. I ended up with a grade that I am very happy with, but it came a little too close for comfort ;) Perhaps I was too busy enjoying the class?",

The course could perhaps have been faster paced and covered more, but the slow pace allowed the opportunity to do some further self study. The runaway robot and final project allowed the opportunity to apply course concepts and additional self study. I'd highly recommend this course. ",

Professor Thrun keeps the lectures interesting and shows great enthusiasm for the topic. \n\nUltimately though I didn't feel like I got what I wanted out of the course. The connection to robotics was superficial, all of the code is in Python with no hardware required. The algorithms taught are used in robotcs but I didn't feel like we went in depth enough into them that I can comfortably remember how to use them without looking them up again. The class could honestly use a required hardware component (rather than extra credit as it is now) to flush out the classes connection to robotics. \n\nIt has a group project component worth 40% of your grade.

Even though the final project was a group project, I was able to program the primary working code we chose to use in a couple nights and a Saturday.

            "text": "I really enjoyed this class and highly recommend it. Its probably my favorite class taken so far. Yes, there will be coding and yes, it is in C. But its totally doable and a lot of fun. There are four projects (three of them coding, one is an easy report that you can complete over a weekend). I had very limited experience in C (just from college many years ago) and I mainly use higher level languages like Java, C#, JavaScript and Python at work so diving back into C was a little bit of a challenge. But its very doable, do not get scared just because its C and it has pointers and manual memory allocations. You will be fine. Start your projects early and use the Piazza forums. The students are super helpful and there are always active discussions talking about common bugs or sharing online resources. Use the provided VM! Do not try to write and run programs in your own setup! Its not worth it and will only lead to headache. When you start the projects, break them down into bite size chunks. The projects themselves are fairly large (all of your time will be spent here) but if you set small milestones/goals you will complete the projects in no time. ",

Cons (basically all of them are about organization, and indicative of a first-run of the class. they're sure to improve. ) * Grading is slow * The exams seem to need a little work in their wording and alignment with class material. There were many discussions of confusion in the piazza forums after the midterm and one of the midterm questions had to be regraded * If you've never done any C before, you're going to have a huge learning curve on the first project. A brief intro to C concepts optional lecture could go a long way here. * This class used ProctorU. Ugh. ",

The midterm content was no surprise but it was challenging. The projects are easily the biggest time investment. Based on voluntary polls I conducted on G+ students reported spending on average about 40 hours on project one and three, and about 5 hours on average on project 2 and 4. There are also many opportuniteis for extra credit. There are very easy ways to prepare for this course, download an ubuntu linux VM and start writing C that reads and writes from files, sends text and data overa TCP/IP socket, performs string manipulation, and parses command line arguments. These skills were necessary to complete the projects, but not the focus of the project. Despite how much work these projects require, you have plenty of time to start on them (you can start project one on day 1 and it is due 6 weeks in). NOTE: I spent on average 10-15 hours per week, but this is because I worked ahead on light weeks. If you strictly follow the syllabus you will not succeed. For example the first two weeks of the course only took about 2 hours a piece to complete, but I used that time to start project 1 early and it paid off. Start early, use the forums on Piazza, get used to linux and C, and fight the urge to be a perfectionist. It is easy to self induce work on these projects and overwhelm yourself. There is no need to turn in production quality code. ",

This class gives you a broad understanding about linux OS but does get into detailed discussions about multithreading and multiprocessor systems. I do agree with others here that the project descriptions are not very well defined but the office hours really helped in better understanding of what was required. Piazza was exploding with information and discussions with high level of participation from students, TAs and professor Ada. Infact I believe it was piazza discussions that really helped me with the projects. Knowing atleast a bit of C, functions and pointers in C and creating a robust linked list program prior to the course will be very useful. The linked list that I created for project 1, I reused it for project 3. The classes were very well organized and lots of effort and thought has been put into organizing this class. Really very rewarding and a blissful experience. This is my first semester and I really hope the remaining OMSCS is atleast or better than this class in terms of class organization. ",

They are responsive on the forums, encouraging when students are in panic mode, and patiently responsive to criticism of content / organization. Really impressed with them. The relationship has felt surprisingly personal. Hopefully that persists beyond their first semester. \n\nThe projects can be very time consuming. I echo that you need to know C. Some specific C skills you'll need and are expected to have for Project 1 are the following:\n\n - string manipulation (i. e. , strcpy, strcat, strtok) and understanding/using null-terminated strings\n - use of pointers; nothing too complex like pointer arithmetic, but knowing how to initialize them, malloc space for them, derefence a pointer, and use the address of a variable as a pointer reference\n - general memory functions like malloc, free, memset -- this might be challenging if you've only used more abstract languages like Java and C#; took a while for me to wrap my head around it\n - file I/O: binary read/write, reading a file size (lseek) \n - using proper header files for prototyping (. h files) and (in later projects) incorporating provided. h files to implement APIs\n - creating a basic Makefile to build your application (though after Project 1 they started providing these)\n - creating a queue (linked list) structure and the functions needed to queue and dequeue items in an instance of that structure (again, after Project 1 they provided a library for this; not sure if future iterations of the class would go ahead and throw that in as a resource for the first project)\n\nYou're expected to be able to do the above with only the most basic and standard C libraries. We were allowed to ask if we could use a certain library to complete parts of our projects, but to my knowledge none of the small handful of requests were approved. But once C starts clicking and you get a handle on the basics, you don't really need any special libraries. \n\nThere's also a brief overview early on of how to create a basic web server and web client that communicate over a socket, which you'll have to implement and expand on (every project is a client/server combination). I found it to be a little too basic, but I was also struggling to get my C legs (get it?). I'd recommend that if you're a C noob, you also find a good introduction to connecting to, sending, and receiving over a socket. The first project requires that as part of its functionality, but while there's a lot more to it than that, I found it to be one of the most time-consuming portions. \n\nIf that seems overwhelming, I can say that I started the course with no previous C experience. I had primarily done C# and Java coding prior to taking this class, and I was able to get up to speed. If you have decent coding experience, you'll be fine. You'll just learn how much you take for granted. :) \n\nAs far as the material/exams go, I found that to be very easy to handle. The lectures aren't terribly long, they build on each other well, and (bonus!) they include a lot of fun graphics. I had no former exposure to most of the lesson topics, and I found the majority of the material very accessible. \n\nOh! A lot of people used valgrind and gdb for debugging, as well. ",

However, the projects are extremely frustrating. A lot of people think that it's due to C programming. But I don't think so. They're frustrating because they're contrived to be difficult. The instructor has only one solution in mind. But they don't provide you any guidelines. And then you have to spend endless hours trying to figure out what they had in mind. Obviously there are so many other ways to solve the problem. But you're constrained to figure out what to do with the terse and convoluted code skeleton provided without much explanation. And then there's the whole mess of the autograder which only works with the solution they had in mind. Other working solutions might fail the autograder with mysterious messages. The TA's would never acknowledge the problems with the autograder and would always blame it back on the student. The only help they provide is very genericand doesn't help much. At the end of all of it, you're not given any solution guidelines. So you don't really learn what you did wrong and how you could improve. I have professional experience using C for a couple years. C is not the problem. I have a job that requires no more than 40 hours a week. But at the job I have to be intense and sharp. This course has definitely affected my job. All these hours of frustrating project work got to me and it was interfering with my work. I'm not sure I would recommend taking this course if you're full-time employed. I definitely learned a few things. But was it worth all the effort and frustration? I'm not sure",

Regarding the projects I think there were a few misconceptions - firstly I don't think that C is a massive hurdle here that it is percevied to be. I think the real challenge is coming up with a suitable design to fulfill project objectives. I acknowledge that the autograder can be frustrating at times but it did make me think critically about what I was intending my code to do and what it was actually doing. When I reconciled my design and objectives the autograder would be happy. Secondly, I spent too much time on design and underestimated the amount of testing that was required. The projects are a little thin on specification so it is more or less up to you to devise suitable test cases that match what you think the project objectives are. The marks that I lost in assignments were in hindsight I think due to not thinking more about testing. The problem here is that you will clock a lot of hours. At some point I just had to say enough and move on. ",

Everything else is explained in the lectures. Projects 1 and 3 are large and complicated and will require a lot of time -- especially if you have to try to learn C at the same time. I would highly recommend starting the projects as soon as they are available to make sure you have enough time to finish them (and try to get it through the autograder). The code skeletons and Udacity autograder are new this semester, as I understand it. I personally enjoyed the projects the most from this class, and while the autograder can be frustrating at times (when the feedback is too vague, or you don't really get any at all), I was always able to find the issue by doing more testing of corner cases myself, which would uncover a crash or deadlock in certain circumstances. The benefit is that you once you've passed the autograder you can be confident that you've done things correctly. I also like the new phased approach to the first project, where you have a few 'build-up' assignments that you should complete before the main project. I personally didn't find the code skeletons a problem or too restrictive, although understanding how it all fits together can be overwhelming at first. By looking at what is given in the skeleton and how certain functions are defined you should be able to figure out how to make everything fit together. Although, I'm not a programmer, so perhaps having some 'embedded direction' is more helpful to me than someone who has a lot more experience. ",

The typical first-run course snafus with project definitions and scheduling were compounded by some medical problems that the instructor had during the semester, so our experience might not be all that representative going forward. That said, almost 2/3 of the semester were spent on just getting some basic concepts down for python and finance, and we didn't even approach any ML until almost November. The projects themselves were fine. Because of the problems that I mentioned, we had a short runway to complete some of the projects (we didn't get the description of one of the projects until after the planned due date had already passed), and they had to shuffle the syllabus around a bit to accommodate (including dropping the final exam). I assume that wont be a problem in future semesters. They went away from an autograded project to a written report on the later projects, and finishing the report proved to be time consuming for me. But they are flexible and provide 5 late days for projects that you can use however you want during the semester. \n\nGreat instructor and staff, and a fun course. You will enjoy it!",

You will definitely learn a lot if you take it, both in terms of how to think about financial data, some financial concepts, how to work with Python libraries (especially NumPy and Pandas), and some machine learning topics. \n\nI think this course would be a great course to take before Machine Learning, because it introduces you to the topic of machine learning in a more gentle manner than the Machine Learning course. I paired this course with Computability, Complexity, and Algorithms, and that worked out okay. \n\nEven though this course was not extremely hard, I actually feel like it is one of the better and more beneficial courses in the program. It is both highly practical and very enjoyable. And I think that is true even if you never write another piece of code having to do with trading after the class is over. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind. While the workload is lower during the beginning of the semester, the projects towards the end of the semester are significantly more time-consuming. So keep that in mind when considering your schedule. ",

I took it in the Summer Semester and it was definitely 'jam packed', requiring my full-time attention. I would recommend the class during either the normal Fall or Winter schedules, but not during the reduced timeframe Summer schedule. My '30 hours per week' would probably be less had the course been spread over the normal amount of time. \n\nI would seriously recommend either taking the CP or CV class before taking this class or have a decent amount of experience using Python's PIL image module. Without this background, you'll be at a disadvantage with the projects. I spent a lot of time learning image processing and went down a lot of dead-ends on my projects because I wasn't prepared for the visual processing aspect of the projects. IMHO, taking CP or CV should be a prerequisite of the class, or at least strongly encouraged. \n\nDavid Joyner is an excellent and enthusiastic teacher, unlike some in this program who seem totally 'checked-out'.

            "text": "I had previously taken the class when it was offered on Udacity as a MOOC before it became a \"for-credit\" class at GT. It's exactly the same. I had been hoping that it was 'beefed up' a bit for a graduate program but it's not. \n\nThe best part of this class is that Sebastian is a great teacher and enthusiastic about his work. While he doesn't participate much in the forums, he does conduct live office hours (or at least he did the semester I was taking it. ) This is where you can 'go deeper' on the material and learn from the master. This is really the best reason to take the class if you're interested in robotics. Sebastian is a 'god-amongst-men' in the world of robotics and you're unlikely to ever get so much valuable face time with somebody of his caliber as easily. \n\nThe projects are pretty easy. (KBAI and Computer Vision have way harder problems sets) The TAs were responsive and held regular office hours using Google Chat which allowed students to view them after the fact. (This skill set seems to allude TAs in other classes, so kudos to the AI for Robotic TAs for figuring this out. )\n\nThere is an allowance to let the students either propose their own projects or work on the 'assigned' final project. Due to an illness, I had to work on the assigned final project, which is what most of the class did anyway. Frankly this assigned final project is pretty much a waste of time and a 'fool's errand. ' While you apply what you've learned, very little of it makes much difference to the end results. Most teams perform not much better than random chance. We scored on the 'high side' of that Gaussian curve, but my suspicion is it had little to do with coding and more the random initial state. There were a few teams that applied some sophisticated CV + machine learning that performed better, but that has more to do with those skills than the Robotics AI taught in this class. \n\nI would highly recommend that you take advantage of the opportunity to propose your own robotics project. This will allow you to pick a problem that is directly related to robotics rather than the contrived one that seemed pretty pointless. If I had it to do over again, this is where I'd make my change.

The projects have definitely been beneficial, but the organization/timeliness of the course team and how/when these projects were presented and what they actually covered was a bit disappointing. Yes, it was the first semester this was offered, so I expected it to be imperfect and feel the students have had grace for that. Going into the semester, I was thinking that between the two brand new courses I was taking, this would be the more organized b/c the instructor had taught this multiple semesters, already had a class website, and had an environment already setup. Another of the disappointments I have had are that many of the final projects have been filled with coding the underlying ML algorithms from scratch rather than actually applying ML to the quantitative finance domain. It seemed that ML knowledge was prerequisite for the course, so I therefore thought that's what the course was about. I'd expect some of this implementation of the basic workhorse algorithms in ML to be in an ML class... kind of like our implementation requirements of 7641. With that mindset, it seemed rather frustrating to receive project assignments approx. 1 week prior to the due date that were requiring this type of development... and again, not necessarily tied-to the trading / computational finance domain. I wish we could have spent the time working on some of the things that the extra credit proposed instead of working on developing my own KNN learner, bag (bootstrap aggregator) learner, Qlearner, or Dyna. \n\n... All that said, it really was a great class and I learned a lot. I actually began really liking Python through this course... it's mandatory, so be ready. Those taking the class do come away with a decent set of software that could be further developed to make a nice personal trading system.... or, if motivated enough, I suppose you could even start your own hedge fund.

            "text": "This is your warning: steer clear of this class. If at all possible, avoid taking it until the instructors have raised the quality bar. \n\nComputer Networks is an interesting and important field of study within Computer Science. This is knowledge that you should gain. Unfortunately, the structure and presentation of this class is incredibly frustrating and ambiguous. You still really struggle to get an A in this class because the class is poorly designed. The content isn't inherently challenging. The class is just designed to make it hard to do well. \n\nLectures: the lectures are quite poor and disorganized. There is no clear thread tying them together and complex concepts pop up and vanish again for the remainder of the course within a single breath... until they show up later on a quiz (more below). The lecture content has tremendous breadth but is frequently covered at such a shallow and unclear level that it is practically useless. If you want to spend hours reading Wikipedia articles, trying to understand what the professor is trying to teach, take this course. \n\nTests/quizzes: oh boy... most quizzes are \"select all of the correct responses\" style. Which means that 6-question quizzes essentially entail digging for minutia in order to discount even a single potential response. Prepare yourself for hours of Google + Wikipedia + watching random YouTube videos in the hope of uncovering a kernel that may/may not help you answer the question. Frequently, the wording on quizzes was so ambiguous that Piazza was flooded with questions and office hours were spent asking the instructor to clarify the same question over and over again. What seems like an easy \"1 quick quiz per week or two\" turns into a 3-4 day treasure hunt with the hope that an instructor might properly explain the intent of a question/answer option. \n\nProjects: the only good part of this course. The projects were occasionally a bit trivial but gave some programming practice in Python and helped to give a few concepts the depth of understanding that they deserve. Even the projects though were fraught: the instructors had to make the last project optional since so many people weren't able to understand it/make it run on their virtual machines. \n\nI'll repeat it again: this class is not inherently challenging. From previous semesters, it looks like this class was \"take this if you want an A\" easy. Instead of making projects more challenging or treating the content at any additional depth, the instructors simply made it more difficult to get an A. This course is difficult because of ambiguity, a lack of depth and poor assessments. \n\nIn case you were wondering, these concerns were raised to the instructors multiple times on Piazza throughout the semester. Each time, they were met with a shrug or a reason why the students' concerns were invalid. For me, this exemplifies a lack of awareness and understanding among the instructors for students who are just trying hard to learn. \n\nKeep in mind that I'm currently scoring in the 85%+ range. I put in a lot of time for this class. I wish I could have invested that time elsewhere. ",

Prof. Prvulovic's explanations left very little doubt on almost all the topics he covered in the lectures. I have them all downloaded & can keep going back for reference. Although a more active participation on piazza would have made the learning experience even better. But, having gone to a college here in the US for my masters' I know it's almost not possible to get full attention of a Prof all the time... \nPerhaps some homework assignments would have helped improve the understanding even better (& helped in the midterms :)). The projects were interesting and were useful in applying what we learn in the classes. There were lot of complaints about the SESC simulator code in general. Its very understandable that the code is in that state having changed so many hands. Don't have much to complaint about this course in general. \nOverall experience with the course has been very satisfying.",

I enjoyed the content very much, which was an advanced rehearsal of the software architecture classes I received in college, and the programming portion wasn't difficult at all. \n\nThere was a lot of documentation to write. You need to be ready for it and feel comfortable creating UML diagrams and writing lots and lots of content. This is tricky because your evaluation will highly depend on what somebody else interprets of your writing. In Software there are usually multiple ways to skin a cat, so you need to make sure to show the instructors that your way is a valid one. \n\nThe course uses Java throughout. If you have used it before, you shouldn't have any problems getting by. The material is not complicated, and I enjoyed the different programming assignments. The final project is the development of an Android application, which will take some time. I did Android before, so I felt right at home, but I saw some people struggling because the learning curve wasn't easy. \n\nDuring the class, you are part of a team that works the projects together. Teams are somehow hit or miss; there's usually somebody that does very little to help during the class. If you are unlucky, you can find yourself bearing most (if not all) of the work. At the end of the project, you get to evaluate each team member, which is appropriate and forces people to try to be helpful. \n\nIn the end, it was an excellent course, and I loved the material. Although I was very familiar with the topic, I had the opportunity to rediscover things that I had long forgotten. The workload stretched me enough, and I highly recommend it for anyone working in the Software industry.",

The projects in the final machine learning mini-course get a little more tricky. I was basically watching four or five lectures the day before the assignment was due, not having any problems, coding the project, and getting solid marks. Do NOT try to do that in the ML portion of the course. \n\nThe ML concepts are not difficult, but the projects can take a little work to get right. I probably spent ~16 to ~24 hours on each of the final three projects.

When you're not writing you're working on your project. Oh, you also have a write up for that. Don't believe if anyone says that you only need to do the minimum amount for the papers. The students that are held in high regard for assignments turn in 2x to 3x what is required and everyone else is held to that standard. Th project is ongoing and does not really offer any opportunity to develop meaningful AI algorithms that you learn in class. There is hardly anytime to write a great AI agent because you spend so much time writing. That's what I really couldn't stand about the class, too much talking about theory and not enough time spent on actually implementing the ideas. I'm sure there are students that will argue my experience, but I want to actually program to see what they are talking about actually works in the real world. I felt the lectures were too high level and the examples were at the grade school level. So it was really difficult to find value in the lectures. This is not a critique against the professor and the TA's they are great! It just that the material could have been presented better. If you're looking to learn some cool AI techniques, you're not going to find them here. This class is really an intro to cognitive AI, nothing more. It is broad sweeping with no real substance. ",

A normal week I probably spent about 10 hours, but weeks in which projects were due it was more around 20-25 hours. The material itself is not very difficult, and I enjoyed the subject topics covered. The lectures were very informative and to the point, though at times a bit dated. The professor states how it is hard to teach design, as design is best learned by doing. Yet most of the assignments were short 7 page research papers on various subjects, when smaller programming assignments or design problems would have been a better choice. I did learn a lot about the subject and thought it was well presented. That being said, I do have two major gripes about this course:\n\n1. Feedback and Grades. I understand that these large online classes tend to have a less than ideal student to grader ratio. But it took a VERY long time to get feedback on turned in assignments. Sometimes grades would come back without feedback, leaving me wondering why I got points off. There were several assignments that were not returned before the final exam or before the last project were due, which would have been extremely useful for the completion of those two. Throughout the semester it was hard, if not impossible, to tell how well you were doing because we didn't have any graded assignments returned, even though some were due 1+ months prior! The TAs also seemed to avoid questions on Piazza asking about when we would receive grades back, or just give an answer saying they did not know. \n\n2. Group projects. BEWARE OF GROUP PROJECTS. The assignments for this class were mostly all done in groups. At the start of the semester the group forming process was not made clear whatsoever. We were asked to make 1 min long intro videos about ourselves and our experience, which I assumed would be used to help form groups. But we never saw them. When the first group assignment came out, we had to use Piazza to try to hastily form a group. And as it turned out, that was the group we had to use for the entire semester. If I had known that, I would have taken more care into the selection of my group members. Most of the assignments ended up being research papers, but the last major project required significant software development. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN SELECTING YOUR GROUP!! Other members of my group were not well versed in software development, while I am. This left me to do a huge portion of the project just due to time constraints and my previous experience. I honestly would have been better off doing it all myself. Keep this in mind if you take this course!\n\nOverall I give this course a 4/5. I enjoyed the material and learned a lot about software architecture and design. While time consuming, I enjoyed the class. Just learn from my naivety and be careful when selecting a group",

Be prepared to spend a most of your time working on problem sets and tweaking parameters to get the perfect result. Also, be prepared to have your mind warped by some of the math involved. If you are familiar with Python and Numpy, you will be in a good position when you start this class. I myself was not a Python / Numpy expert, so there was a bit of a learning curve for me there too. \n\nLike others have mentioned, this class was recently taken over by a new professor who did not participate on Piazza a lot. You will have to lean on your fellow classmates and TAs if you get stuck. Other than that, this class is awesome. I highly recommend it. It might be painful at times but, if you push through, you will be glad you did. I learned a ton in this class. ",

There has clearly been an attempt to make the class harder even though I believe some leniency was given near the end of the semester making the grades much higher. This is my first class and below is my review:\nPros:\nClass projects were interesting and fun\nThe professor holds regular office hours and is responsive during those times\nEducational and I learned alot, granted I didn't know anything about networks going in. \nCons:\nTest questions lead to ambiguity and make it harder. Even when valid arguments were given for bad questions no credit was normally given. Meaning people never really well explained how they were wrong. \nLast project didn't work well and instead of fixing just made it optional as a way to replace. Project was really interesting and wish it had been fixed. \nTAs were fairly helpful in Piazza but the Professor was very slow at responding to things needing his attention. Overall many times got more clarification from classmates than from the TA or professor on Piazza. I feel lucky we had some talkative classmates. \nAlot of need to research outside sources to get answers to test questions. Not testing my understanding but my ability to clarify the statements. \nVideos didn't spend enough time explaining complex concepts forcing extra research as well. ",

IOS was a good basis when you're not already familiar with C and systems programming. \nEvery lecture walks students through a single paper, explaining the concepts and adding historical, academical context. The selection of papers is very good, it's a journey through landmark ideas in systems research. Reading all the papers was impossible for me with a day job and hobbies. I resorted to reading the abstract and summaries (provided by peres as part of course requirements) for about three quarters of the material. \nThe grading of projects and exams seems fair and forgiving. \nThe projects are tough and require recognizing challenges and coming up with your own designs for them. Also you have to write your own test code, which can be a substantial part of the project. It is always recommended to start working on the project 2-3 weeks in advance to be able to ask questions on Piazza and also just to sleep over it and find solutions to problems. They are definitely not \"just doing the exercise\". \nThe course requires a bit of investment, but offers tremendous learning opportunity. I was also constantly drifting off into the subjects covered while browsing through Wikipedia, research papers and technical manuals. ",

These notes are copy & pasted from the Piazza forum of the course. \n\nI did not like this course very much. Disliked the flow of the lectures, had a hard time following what Dr. Goel tried to explain and could not relate lecture content to the projects really. Has been the most frustrating class so far in my curriculum. I really liked the organization and effort that went into the interactive exercises, the overall communication, grading and the friendly frequent contact. David's been a great instructor. \n\nThe whole educational strategy of this course is brilliant. I would love seeing it applied to other courses. \n\nI can appreciate how the KBAI class falls into the \"academic-style thought\" bucket. I admit, I might have approached the class from a wrong angle, even though it said so right on the labelling. \n\nBut then I doubt the validity of your airplane analogy. Of course the airplane project would not touch upon every subject, but conversely the lectures should instruct how to actually design such a plane. Or at least point to the right resources, tutorials or books. I just thought it would not hurt to slide in a lecture or two that examines the design and implementation of a couple of cool and interesting classic or modern AI agents (maybe a simple one right in the first week to illustrate what we're talking about, a more complex one in the middle and an advanced one at the end). I would argue it would strengthen the understanding of the high level concepts being thought. ",

I spent a lot of time working on this course (at least 20 hours per week), and I did have a CS undergrad for what it's worth (its almost 8 years old). \n\nThe grading scheme is 1/3 homework, 1/3 midterm and 1/3 final. The homework assignments are very challenging, and often times the mean score for an assignment was around 10-11 of 16. There were opportunities for extra credit to improve the homework score. A small minority of these problems are python programming assignments. This should not be your focus in preparation. \n\nThe questions on the midterms and final are easier than the homework, but they are timed and I was unable to attempt all problems on either test. This was very common among other students as well. The mean grades for the exams were in the 50s. The grades are all \"curved\" for lack of a better term to be normalized to a standard 10 point grade bracketing. \n\nYou will definitely want to prepare ahead of time for the course. Some things I wish I had studied prior (and other useful topics):\nMathematical Notation : Summation, Dot Product, etc\nSet Theory\nGraph Theory\nAsymptotic Runtime Analysis (Big-O notation)\nTime Complexity Classes\n\nI highly recommend you check out the lectures on the public Udacity site prior. While they won't necessarily prepare you for the assignments, if you can't understand the notation used in the lectures, you should review it until you do. \n\nOne thing I will mention regarding some of the other reviews: there is a very specific academic integrity guideline when it comes to using outside resources (not the lectures or prescribed textbooks). We had some significant issues with plagiarism concerns on one of the homeworks which led to some grades being lowered to 0.

The lectures are barely useful. They gloss over the material and give no concrete examples that are on par with the homework. These are some of the shortest lectures of any OMSCS course I've taken (out of 6) and this is the hardest of any of the OMSCS courses by far. That's a problem. I also think the level of mastery expected by the professor is unreasonable in a single course. There should be a prerequisite for this course. The difficulty is just unreasonable for students that are new to the material. It sounds like earlier professors were more reasonable about this and graded accordingly. \n\nMy advice?

The course is made up of 4 projects, a midterm, final, and class participation on Piazza. The lectures are great and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching them on at least 1. 25x speed. I started doing this halfway through the semester (eventually bumped up to 1. 5x when re-watching) and realized I could retain a lot more info than having to keep rewinding because my mind was drifting. Only a handful of papers to read, most were pretty dated but helped drive some concepts home. If you are looking for an easy class though, this is not for you. I feel this has prepared me well for the workload/work ethic necessary to succeed in classes to come. You get out what you put in!\n\nAlso 'Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces' is a free online book that I referenced A LOT to give me an intro into the topics discussed in the lectures. Chapters are short and easy to read/comprehend. Highly recommend it!\n\nFull Details:\nThe projects are, as mentioned everywhere else, difficult and clarification of parts are necessary. I would recommend being comfortable with at least the basics of C (pointers, func pointers, extern usage, getopts, string parsing, file manipulation, etc. ). For some that might be too basic but if you know how to read through the provided code then you should be okay to at least get through the simpler portions of the projects. You will want to start looking into the basics of socket communication, posix threading library, posix/sysv IPC mechanisms and synchronization. You will be provided enough material to get you going with each of the items listed in the last sentence. \n\nThe midterm and final are not easy and it is not enough to \"memorize\" formulas/concepts. You will need to understand the purpose and how each input to the problems/equations affect the output and then formulate what pieces are necessary to come to the correct answer. You will really have to understand the material. That said it is possible to do well. Participating in Piazza discussions, re-watching lectures, and doing the projects will prepare you well in understanding the concepts/problems on the exam. \n\nOne thing you might not expect is that you are provided an Ubuntu VM that is set up to test your projects in before trying the auto-grader in Udacity. Valgrind and GDB will be your best friend and help you find things that the auto-grader will detect and fail your submission even though things in the VM work fine. I would recommend some sort of version control too (I used git)!",

            "text": "This is a very difficult class. I spent at least 30 hours a week on homework, and I have a CS/Math background. Some things I'd recommend before beginning the class:\n\n* Get familiar with mathematical notation. I spent lots of time early on just trying to figure out how to read and understand the assignments, let alone work through solutions. \n* Familiarize yourself with basic proof methods (induction, direct, contradiction). Luckily I had an old discrete math book from undergrad lying around that was very helpful in the beginning weeks of the course. It's also worth skimming over general topics in discrete math (and probably some from graph theory as well). \n\nI can't emphasize enough how little free time I had during this class. I had time to go to work, come back home and study/do homework for 3-4 hours, and then go to bed. I also spent most weekends working on homework. 16 weeks of this is draining--I can't imagine doing this with a family and/or other obligations. However, the work I put in definitely paid off. I was able to get over 100% as my homework average, which balanced out a mediocre performance on the final. I ended up with an A (barely). \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures for this class were very hit and miss for me. I really enjoyed the first half of the class, and thought the lectures did a better job of thoroughly explaining the concepts. The second half of the class was less enjoyable for me. The lectures seemed to assume a very strong background in linear algebra and didn't work through examples at some crucial points (thinking specifically of the linear programming lectures). I took linear algebra in undergrad and so that part wasn't so bad, but the lack of examples on things like the Simplex method really made things difficult. Don't try to breeze through the lectures. When watching, I would rewind a portion 3 or 4 times with pencil and paper in front of me. If I didn't understand a concept, I'd rewatch until I could write it out in my own words. This helped in the long run, but was excruciatingly slow. There were several times, especially during the second half of the semester, that consulting Google for lecture notes from other programs was beneficial. If you do this, make sure you cite your source if you're working on homework. \n\nHomework:\nFor me, the homework in this class was the most valuable part of the class. Dr. Pryby's assignments were extremely difficult (hours and hours of work), but they forced you to understand the concepts in the lectures, and stretched you to think deeply about the topics. The feeling you get when you figure out that key piece of insight is amazing. This is where you should really focus your efforts. It is possible to get > 100 as your homework average if you work hard enough, and this can help pick up crucial slack for the midterm and final. The only real complaint I have about the homework is that sometimes the solutions were not presented very well. I'd prefer to see solutions in as dumbed-down terms as possible so that the class can easily follow how a particular solution was derived. Go to as many office hours as you can--occasionally I didn't think I needed any help on a homework, but joined anyway and the TA would basically give you the answer, or give you an insight that made you change your answer for the better. \n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this review, it's to start the homework early. Being able to grind away at a proof over the course of 2 or 3 days is just not something you can pack into an hours long window (unless you're a math whiz). Give yourself enough time to really think about the problems. Write an answer out, then come back to it a few days later and see if it makes sense. \n\nTests:\nThe tests were extremely stressful. Unless you're a genius, you probably aren't going to finish all of the problems. You have 3 hours to complete 8 to 10 problems, some of which are formal proofs. That gives you 18 to 22 minutes on each problem. One strategy I adopted was to go through the entire test and work on problems that I immediately had insight on. It's not worth spending 30 minutes on a problem you just don't get, and then missing a problem that you might have been able to quickly grasp. The reality for me was that in a timed situation, I was either going to immediately have some insight into the problem, or I wasn't (and if I didn't get it immediately, spending 10-20 minutes on it was not likely to help). I felt absolutely terrible after both tests, but the average turned out to be in the 40s or 50s for each one, so as long as you meet or exceed the average, you should be fine. Another tip--the graders *want* to give you points. Write down _anything_, even if you know it's not totally right or if it seems silly. You never know--you might end up getting a fraction of a point. And for this class, every little bit helps. \n\nPart of the stress for me with the tests was the ProctorTrack system that was used. I was terrified that my internet connection would drop, someone would come in the room, or some other infraction would occur and I'd fail. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThis is only my second class, but the TAs all were very helpful, I thought. They were empathetic with students and were encouraging during office hours. They held frequent office hours and had \"watch together\" sessions. They were also very available on Piazza (at least compared to the other class I've taken). Dr. Pryby was also fairly active on Piazza. One feedback that I think most students had was that the office hours should be recorded. There was some pushback from the instructors on this, but maybe they'll change it in future semesters. \n\nAs for the grading--for a class involving writing proofs, I thought the grading was quite fair. If you think about it, any error in a proof makes the entire proof totally invalid. From this perspective, getting partial credit is generous. Show all of your work, and if you're not sure if you should include or explain something--just go ahead and do so. This should go without saying, but participate in as much extra credit as you possibly can. You need every point you can muster. \n\nBooks:\nJust go ahead and get both of them. At some points during the semester, I needed a combination of book + videos to understand the concepts. In many cases, the books were much clearer than the lectures. CLRS is probably worth having on your bookshelf anyway. \n\nConclusion:\nThis was a very rewarding class. I feel like the my knowledge of the foundations of computing is now very solid. At the same time it was extremely stressful. I wouldn't recommend taking it and expecting an A if you have other life commitments. Good luck!",

It really does require knowledge of about 36 white papers in order to answer the questions on the exams. I came across 3 questions on each of them that i had no idea what paper they came from, let alone what they were referring to. I spent days cramming, and re-watching the lectures. \n\nThe projects are not impossible, but are very time-consuming in order to write, debug and get to pass auto-grader, and corner-case testing, however, given enough time (2-3 weeks) you can complete them. I completed 2 of 4 with A's but they took 40+ hours to get that over 3 weeks. I am a novice C programmer, so that was my downfall. I'm sure others with a high level of C programming did them in half or less time, but they are covering subjects and APIs that we are given and forced to use, that come with no instructions, we had to fumble about them to figure out how to use them correctly. \n\nIOS will help, if you are not fluent with C. Overall this is definitely one of the harder classes in the program, BUT I did learn a lot, and I'm a better C programmer because of it. \n\nOH one more weird thing... the PIAZZA participation grade (3% overall), seems to be based on an algorithm of Days logged on, posts read, and contributions. The number one contributor gets a 3, everyone else gets something less. There were just a few days difference between our top two contributors (600+ posts each), and one got a 3, while the other got a 2. 9.

            "text": "It's pretty hard for me to give an accurate commentary on this class because I have such an unusual background, but I can only really give advice that would be applicable to the general population interested in taking this course. About 35-40% of the students will drop, and this has been consistent throughout the terms so far. General programming experience almost doesn't even matter, but having the right experience does. People with 10 years of programming experience struggled. For reference, I had maybe worked a job using a higher level language than C for about a few months before taking this course, and most of my academic and job experience was fairly nontechnical in nature. I did not even graduate in STEM. \n\nOf course, understanding C is necessary to do well, but I can promise you that not knowing C is NOT the primary limitation that most people will suggest. Being able to take a spec, design a solution, test it thoroughly, and refactor to apply the right patterns are far more indicative of whether or not you will succeed in this course. I didn't find the programming assignments particularly difficult, but a lot of people struggled against the autograder so a bit of gusto for debugging would certainly help you as well. You should still start the projects early so that you can let the ideas marinate in your head as you're going about your daily routine. The tests were nothing to write home about; just your standard review of the details will do. What helped me most was taking screenshots of key video stills into OneNote and maybe writing a few supplemental notes to jot down specifics as I listened along at 2x speed. That workflow was sufficient enough for me to grasp the material. \n\nGoing by the reviews, this, Machine Learning, and Algorithms are by far the most time-consuming classes. I heard somewhere that AOS was easier, but the statistics seem to reflect an equivalent success rate (~40% drop). All of these classes will expect different things out of you, and this course in particular should challenge your programming abilities relative to other courses. Operating Systems classes are notorious for having the most legitimate programming assignments, whereas Algorithms on the other end of the spectrum expect you to have a higher level of mathematical maturity and the ability to write proofs, which fewer people possess. I CAN give advice on the latter, but this is not the review for that :)\n\nInstructor and TA support was pretty top notch from what I saw, although this won't be the case for every single course in the program. So I would take the course just because the experience was well made and well-supported, but definitely make sure that you have the right background before signing up!",

This takes a while because you have to commit a good deal to memory, so make sure you go through these and also all of the previous midterms and finals (which they also post on T-Square), at least a week or two in advance of the tests. \n\nFinally, to prep for the course, I would strongly advise that you brush up on your C coding. You don't need to be a guru, but make sure you have your dev environment properly set up with a decent IDE, and especially know how to debug programs. I didn't have to use valgrind for any of my projects thanks to the copious amount of unit tests that I wrote, but for the final project I did use valgrind to help me locate a bug.

I find them difficult since I had no previous experience with C. I ended up with an A, so don't walk away from this course just because you don't know C. There's a huge learning curve, especially for project 1. I got great help from TAs and students on Piazza. Project 3 was tricky too because of multi-threading and memory sharing. Project 4 looks straight forward but might take some time to figure out what exactly to implement. \n\nThe curve is very generous and there are several extra credit opportunities.

It's math-heavy and requires a lot of effort and tricks. \n\nYou should avoid it if you:\n- have other commitment and can't put in a lot of hours every week. \n- want to get a solid A easily by watching and memorizing the videos\n- need time to pick up writing math proofs\n\nIf you decide to take it, make sure you:\n- understand basic algorithms such as sorting, depth-first-search, breath-first-search etc\n- know some linear algebra and be comfortable with matrices\n\nLectures: be prepared to spend 20 min on a 5 min video. Either you watch it 3, 4 times to finally get it, or find a 20-min YouTube video that covers the same material but is easier to follow. In a way it's good because you'll end up learning so much. However it's very time consuming and there's a lot of responsibilities on the students. The recommended books are helpful too. \n\nHomework: the problems are interesting but tough. Most requires some tricks. Try your best to complete all. You effort will be rewarded on the exams. Start early. Twice I started the homework on Saturday and had to stay up until 3am on Monday. I don't know if they'll continue to offer extra credit for doing peer reviews, but if they do, don't skip them. Any extra credit will help with your grade. \n\nExams: spending 3 hours with difficult problems are just brutal. On both exams I spent a lot of time on the 1st question just because I was too nervous. I didn't finish all the questions, but at the end I accepted my fate and turned it in. Expect to feel depressed after the tests and expect to get bad scores. Don't be too sad though since there's a big curve afterwards. The grading on the exams is more generous than the homework. If you writing down any clue, as long as it's in the right direction, you'll get more scores than you expect. \n\nTo get an A: take every assignment and exam seriously. Try to stay above 75% on everything. Unlike previous semesters, only ~16% got an A this semester. To get a B: try to stay above the average every time. ",

The result is vaguely worded tests, disappointing grades that are curved down, and core material that is still easy. \n\nThe lectures are good because they cover an interesting range of topics (a broader range than other networking classes I've seen). But they lack a bit in depth and need to be augmented. The current instructors are not the developers of the course and in some instances have a different approach. However they claim that they cannot change a single video segment or annotate it because \"it is easier to redevelop the entire course than it is to change one bit of it. \" I find this claim ridiculous at best. \n\nThe projects are very interesting but a bit easy. Those can definitely be made more challenging. \n\nThe quizes are a mess. They're vaguely worded and depend on the instructor's interpretation. They tend to be open ended, but you're expected to answer with a multiple choice or be constrained to 200 words. And in most cases, you're penalized because either you missed a nuance that's only clear in the instructor's mind, or because you didn't elaborate (although you're constrained to 200 words). My grades were like a crap shoot, totally random per quiz, for an equal amount of preparation for each quiz and understanding of the material. \n\nThe office hours were like a morning radio show with banter and little substance. I can tell that the instructors were trying hard to curve down the grades. Initially they claimed that an A will only be 92 and above (they reduced it later to a 90).

Even so, you should probably expect to spend 20 to 30 hours on two of the four projects. Don't bother with the extra credit options on the projects unless you really want to. They will add quite a bit of additional time while only affecting your grade by about 1% each. \n\nLectures/Tests\nThe lectures are a little slow paced. I watched most of them on speed-and-a-half, which increased my focus considerably. The midterm and final ask detailed questions from the lectures and also contain quite a bit of application material. Strive for understanding of the lectures, rather than memorization, and you'll be fine. \n\nOverall comments\nI got an A in this class without having to sweat too much, mainly because the curve is generous - 81 to 100 was an A in fall 2015. It's an enjoyable class with some interesting material that I didn't encounter in undergrad. Biggest complaint: nothing got graded until the middle of the semester, because nothing was really due until then. The first project is already divided into four deliverables. Releasing separate grades for those components would help students who are unsure of where they stand. ",

Therefore I am quite familiar with the all the course materials yet still it's very challenging for me. \n\nThe first half of the course was about Turing Machine, Decidable, Recognisable and NP-complete, NP-hard. It requires very strong math proving skills. It's ok if you don't understand these concepts prior to the class. Nevertheless, you should be comfortable with reading the proof and checking if one proof is correct or not and writing proofs you know for sure is correct. If you don't know whether you can do these, try to prove quick-sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and is O(nlogn) in expectation. Try to prove that fibonacci series equation\nF_n = (a^n-(-a)^(-n))/sqrt(5), where a = (1+sqrt(5))/2 by mathematical induction. Also the HW0 is somewhat similar to these problems. If you are not comfortable with HW0, drop the course immediately. \n\nThorough out the first half of the course, you should find that most proving problems follow a pattern. For example, how to prove something is undecidable, you reduce it to HALT. how to prove something is decidable, you find a decider. How to prove something is NP-Complete, you first prove it's in NP by providing a verifier verifies the instance in polynomial time and second you reduce the problem to some known NP-Complete problem. As long as you follow the proving patterns, you are in the right direction. Google for solutions of the homework also helps but make sure you understand it and then close the webpage and write your own proof and cite the website in the homework. \n\nThe second half of the course focuses on solvable problems and polynomial time algorithms. While implementing the algorithm is mandatory in the homework, it still places most of the attention on proving the algorithm is correct and analysing the time complexity. Some basic graph concepts and algorithms like bfs, dfs and shortest path will help. Learning these algorithms doesn't mean you can implement the algorithm. Instead, it means you know how to prove the correctness of the algortihm (like what I said, you know for sure your proof is valid) and you know how to analysis the time complexity. \n\nThe homework is hard but try doing all homework including the bonus as much as possible. I particularly enjoy the moment when I solve the problem after 3 hours intensive thinking. Also, I personally think it's better to handwrite all the homework so that writing proof for middle exam and final exam won't be uncomfortable. I don't have much suggestions for the exams. Try doing your best. \n\nHope you all doing well on this course. ",

A large portion of your time will be spent trying to figure out semantics of obscure test questions, troubleshooting faulty project templates, and arguing with instructors. \n\nIt is true the content of this course does not demand a large number of hours per week to read or watch. However, the open-book format of the tests is IN NO WAY an advantage. The “select all that apply” multiple-choice scheme was deemed unfair by MANY students, mostly because of the way T-Square deducts points for incorrectly selected options. Watching the lecture videos, reading the papers, and even participating in office hours do NOT lay the path for scoring well on the tests. \n\nThe projects can be a good source of learning the material, despite the fact they are 80% reading instructions and looking over the supplied templates and 20% actually writing code. \n\nIn the Fall 2015 session, the instructors were mostly attentive to students’ concerns (via Piazza and office hours), even if some answers included “that’s just the way it is, it cannot be changed. ” (This was a common response referring to tests in T-Square). I think the instructors were probably doing the best they could with the atrocious class they were given. However, I doubt any of them would have tolerated the mishaps we students had to deal with. \n\nCONCLUSION: This class needs to be scrapped and totally redone. Both the original content and the delivery of that content are atrocities to the OMSCS program. As stated below, this class IN NO WAY does justice to this VERY important field of Computer Science. If you decide to take this class, and learning the material and scoring well is important to you, PREPARE TO BE THOROUGHLY FRUSTRATED. ",

If you are already an expert in all of those areas then this course will probably not be very informative, but otherwise the course should work well as a first look at those topics. Especially if you are a novice programmer, I would recommend this as one of the few in the OMS program that involves a lot of coding but does not assume much previous coding experience. In terms of both finance and machine learning, only the very basics are covered, but you will get practical experience working with both in the assignments which can help if you decide to pursue each further in the future (such as by taking the Machine Learning course). \n\nIn terms of the course structure, it is heavily programming project-based. The early assignments are very simple but the later assignments become more involved and give more room to go beyond the minimum requirements for extra credit. In the semester I took the course, there were many major problems with grading the assignments which was the only major downside of the course in general. Assuming those issues are resolved for future semesters, the assignments overall are fun and apply the material from the course well. The course was supposed to have both a midterm and a final exam, but the final exam was cancelled due to logistical reasons. The midterm exam was fair in terms of questions although it did involve a lot of memorization for things like library API details and financial formulas. \n\nOverall I would say that if you are interesting in learning the basics of these topics and like working on small programming projects this course is a good choice.

            "text": "This is a very fun course that is heavily project-based, and most of the projects are at least partially open-ended. The assignments are a mix between structured programming assignments that implement specific algorithms covered in the lectures and non-programming assignments that involve more of a focus on photography and using software to manipulate your photos. For most of the assignments completing the assignment as specified correctly only earns a 90% score (which is the cutoff for an A grade in this course) and you are on your own to figure out some way to go \"above and beyond\" to earn the last 10%. I really liked this aspect of the course because it let me pursue my own ideas and experiment with the material from the course on my own. There is also an open-ended final project that can be done individually or as a group, and a final exam. The final exam does a good job covering all of the material from the course and is open-notes, so if you understand the material in the course you should be able to get a good score on it. The overall workload of the course is flexible, especially if you try to go above and beyond for every assignment, and in general you will be rewarded for putting a lot of effort into the course even if your end results are not amazing. \n\nIn terms of what you should know going into the course, general Python and numpy experience will be helpful since there is a fairly large amount of programming in the course, although for the most part the assignments mainly involve understanding how to apply the algorithms from the course rather than involving much complex code. Being familiar with the math used in the course is also very helpful (especially matrix operations which are heavily used) although the lectures do an excellent job of explaining things. Also having a high quality camera is not required, but having a camera that has manual settings for things like exposure time makes many of the photography-based significantly assignments easier (as does having a tripod for your camera). The lectures do not assume any previous knowledge about photography, digital images, or the algorithms used in the course, but those topics are covered in a lot of detail so there is a lot to learn from this course. \n\nOverall I would say if you are interested in photography and image manipulation and want to get some practical experience with both this is a great course.

            "text": "Unlike some, I do not have a very favorable opinion of this class. I did learn quite a bit. But the bottom-line; the amount of time used was excessive compared to the value of the knowledge gained. So, a highly inefficient learning experience overall. I have a strong CS background. As an undergraduate, I received a 3. 97 GPA for my computer science work and have received an A in every other class in the OMSCS program that I have taken for a grade except for this one. In this class, I received a B. In fact, only 16% of the students in this class received an A, and as can be seen by looking at Course Critique (https://critique. gatech. edu/course. php?id=CS6505), the grade distribution with the current instructor is skewed in a direction generally unfavorable to students. So beware, if you choose to take this course, you are in for a huge amount of work and perhaps a significant amount of stress. In my opinion, it would be perfectly reasonable to choose your specialization such that you could avoid this class. Alas, at the moment that would mean that you specialize in Interactive Intelligence, although there might be other ways to dodge this class while specializing in Robotics or Machine Learning in the future if they expand their algorithms offerings. Anyway, in my opinion, this class isn't going to give you any deep insights about the world; but it will seriously mess up your schedule for the semester. It is a perfectly reasonable choice to choose your specialization specifically so you can avoid this class. \n\nThe current instructor, Chris Pryby, has a Ph. D. in mathematics, not in computer science. Not surprisingly, this class has a certain bias towards mathematics. I would say that the way that the class was administered in Fall of 2015 that it is about 80% math and only 20% computer science. Of course, if the instructor were to change, it is perfectly possible for this bias to change as well. To make the point: if you were to choose your undergraduate major based on your desire to complete this class, I would recommend that you major in math rather than computer science. Alas, since most of you have probably finished undergrad, this is a useless point as a practical matter but very important in terms of how you should prepare yourself for success in this class. What is important in this class is not so much your ability to implement any algorithm or concept, but instead to produce mathematical proofs that relate to them. \n\nAs a side note. The mathematics in this class is not particularly hard. I had a colleague at work who was a mathematics major before receiving his Ph. D. in bioinformatics assert that the level of mathematics in this course appeared to be at about an undergraduate level when he saw what I was doing as far as the homework. It is not the formal level of mathematics in this class that makes the course hard, it is the way that this mathematics is taught (or more accurately, really not taught in the class) that makes the course hard. Basically, for this class, you either know the mathematics (including proof techniques) already or you are going to have to teach yourself. I would personally put this up as one of my pet peeves about the course. (And full disclosure, I have several such pet peeves). The lectures are sort of computer science oriented and sometimes even interesting when Lance Fortnow was in the picture. But the homework is really all math. And the math in the homework is not anything that is covered in the lectures. So, if you are someone who likes to learn from lecture like I do, you will be at a disadvantage, because you are going to have to teach yourself any undergraduate-level math concepts you are missing from the Internet or from a textbook or whatever on your own. And you had better hope, based on previous experience, that how you setup the problem is sensible, because there will not be any feedback in terms of lecture about how to solve problems UNLESS you try to find a lecture recorded for some other class that covers the same topic, which can be a hit or miss endeavor. Anyway, as a practical matter for those reading this review, here is my advice. Don't watch the lecture and expect it to help you with the homework, the midterm, or the final all that much. Indeed, there is only a limited relationship between the lecture and the things that determine your grade. Instead of focusing too much on the lecture, I would recommend that you focus on the homework problems and consider the lecture but one resource that MIGHT sometimes be useful in figuring out how to solve the cs-themed math problems that are the bread and butter of this course. As often or not, an outside resource will be more valuable to you than the actual lecture. Do not be surprised by this. For example, at the beginning of the class, I would highly recommend a strong focus on the \"optional\" Sipser textbook in particular. (Oh, and don't be fooled by the syllabus. There is nothing \"optional\" about the recommended textbooks UNLESS you already own a textbook that is substantial similar. ) In fact, if you are taking CS 6505, why are you even reading this review? You should be reading Sipser. \n\nA note about office hours. In the Fall of 2015, there were two types of office hours. Office hours where lecture was watched together and office hours that covered the homework. As I was taking two classes, I personally did not have time to show up to many \"watch together\" type office hours. But the few I did go to were not all that useful. But don't get confused. If you find the \"watch together\" office hours less than useful, don't make the mistake of assuming (like I did early on), that the office hours are a waste of time. In fact, the office hours that go over the homework are pretty much must watch for most people. Indeed, if I were to take the class over again, the first thing I would do when I received the homework is review it and try to complete as much of it as possible before office hours covering that homework is held. Then you will be well-positioned to maximally benefit from office hours and just maybe, have something resembling a normal life. As others have mentioned, it is in office hours that many of the \"hints\" to the \"tricks\" that will otherwise end up consuming your entire life are given. Thus, being properly prepared for office hours is often the only efficient means of solving the homework and the way to steal back some free time from this time-sucking course. So, do not make the mistake I did, which is to insist on watching the lectures before attempting the homework. The lectures (which still are not optional) probably will not help you that much with the homework anyway. Just as often, it will be some third-party source of information that is key. I would also argue if you are a visual learner who likes to learn from seeing others work out problems, that Chris Pryby's office hours should not be skipped, since he has a tablet and works out problems. Other TAs often resort to typing out math in chat, which, in my opinion, barely works and is highly inefficient even when it does work. Oh, and if your schedule doesn't allow you to make it to office hours one week? At least in the Fall of 2015, too bad. Office hours are not recorded like they should be in order to give everyone the same access to the same information. People who have time in their schedule for office hours will have an information advantage over those who do not. (And this is especially critical, because while the lectures often aren't that helpful to solving the homework, midterm, or final, the office hours do cover that sort of information. ) \n\nAnother point. The title of the course Computation, Complexity, and Algorithms. Low and behold, other courses offered at Georgia Tech, but not yet to OMSCS students include Computational Complexity Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and Randomized Algorithms. CCA includes all of these topics, albeit on a sort of superficial level. You would think that since all of these topics are covered, that the course would focus heavily on the interrelationships between them. But despite some noises in the lectures about such interconnections, that is far from the focus in the class. No or little knowledge of interconnections between these topics will help you in the homework, midterm, or final. Anyway, my experience in this class was essentially this. At just about the time I start feeling comfortable, maybe even competent, dealing with one area, it is time to move on to the next. So, don't expect to acquire an especially strong foundation or confidence in any of the topics above as a reward for taking this class (although you should have a reasonable introduction). Maybe the exception is computation, but for that, I would credit the excellent Sipser book, much more than this class. Also, the earlier lectures are much better than later lectures. \n\nAnyway, I am nearly done with my rant. As you might infer from the tone, I did not much like this class. My view is that it is too much work for too little return. Something to be endured, not enjoyed. If CCA were a stock, I would sell it short. But that said, if you take this class, you will learn a lot. It is just that you will have to put in a disproportionate amount of work in learning it. (I feel I would have benefitted more from self-study, where I would control the agenda. ) In terms of grading, you can expect low scores that are then generously curved. But in the end, as a practical matter, much of the class is nearly as much of a test of pre-existing knowledge and mathematical skills as anything else, especially when it comes to setting up problems or figuring out the cute \"tricks\" necessary to get to the end. (And it shouldn't have to be said, but knowing how to setup the problem is probably 50% of the challenge. So focus on that first. ) And while I have seen classes that grade on a curve being well-done, in this case, I believe the curve disguises the fact that the course designers do not have a particularly clear agenda regarding what skills and knowledge they actually expect students to acquire from the class. It is more of, lets test them on a bunch of stuff and see what sticks sort of thing. A curve can (in theory) be the most fair way to grade students; but it can also be a way of concealing flawed course design. In this particular case and for this particular class, I believe it is the latter not the former. \n\nNow, there is a particular sort of person that enjoys this class. And without exception, I believe that what sets those people apart is that they are very well-prepared in terms of mathematics and perhaps in terms of schedule (probably they are only taking one course). As I have said, neither the mathematics nor the insights in the course are all that hard, in retrospect. But what is hard is the amount of material you are expected to cover with inadequate time to cover it systematically and thoroughly due to the lack of a focused and clear learning agenda. For those who come into the course with very solid skills (such that they probably do not even need to take the course, really), then it is a pretty fun problem-solving experience. Maybe it even hits the sweet spot for optimal learning. For everyone else who is going to take this course, I do not believe that you will find this course to be anywhere close to enjoyable or a great use of your time relative to the reward. I certainly did not enjoy the class or feel that it is was a good use of my time. But then again, I am not a math major. Perhaps if I had been one, I would have enjoyed this course too. ",

In that respect you should try to stay on or ahead of the schedule and readings so you don't feel overwhelmed getting prepared for the midterm. \n\nIn terms of the projects, the first one can feel daunting as you must select two datasets to use for this project (and reuse them for parts of later projects) and then apply a bunch of supervised learning methods to the data sets and then compare and contrast. Without giving things away, I would say on that first project try to focus on getting some plots that will help you to compare the algorithms in terms of different parameters, error rates and runtimes. Having the plots is really crucial to doing well on the assignments. As I moved on through the course I also found it helpful to write the report as I went along instead of running a ton of experiments and then trying to write it up at the end - since only the report matters for the project grades the most important thing is to start putting words (and plots) to paper, and that can help with \"analysis paralysis\". \n\nUse the software you are comfortable with for the class. Whether you prefer Python, R, or Java stick with what you like and you will probably be happier. But also the randomized optimization project has a MIMIC implementation in the ABAGAIL package (Java) and the reinforcement learning project works well with BURLAP (Java), and using those may make things easier for those projects. \n\nIf you do use java and want to get a head start on the class one activity that would be useful it watching the Weka tutorial, which walks through how to load data in Weka and use the different classifiers and classifier parameters in Weka. Learning to use either the Weka CLI or APIs to programmatically run classifiers is also helpful as you can use that to run a series of experiments to see how tuning parameters in the learning algorithms impacts the results. \n\nFinally believe Charles when he says not to panic on the midterm results. The mean on our midterm was around 50/100 but that corresponded to the equivalent of an A, and the B range was 20-30 points and up. So even if you feel bad about the midterm don't give up, submit all the projects and you should end up okay. ",

This should tell anyone that this class is broken. \n\nIf you start this class, don't drop it, because chances are you will get scaled to an A or a B. Here is a link to a grade distribution chart that showing there are very few Cs, Ds, and Fs given. http://critique. gatech. edu/prof. php?id=RAMACHANDRANUMAKISHORE#CS6210 \n\nThis was my first class and I would consider it garbage. Yes, I learned a good bit and the concepts in the projects were good. Our class avg on the midterm was a 56. 5 and the median was 57. 75. The grades on the final were mostly C's. Even with such awful grades, I would say they were very gracious in the grading. I got a 77 on the midterm and a 73 on the final, and if they had graded them correctly I would have done much worse. I flat out didn't read the papers, and only studied the videos and my notes on them. I also didn't do the paper summaries and I somehow only got 30% on the message board participation. Actually there were people who posted hundreds of times and were very helpful that only got 2/3 of the participation points. Anyways, I got an 83 unscaled and somehow got an A in the class. Anytime a teach has to scale this much and has such poor test grades, the teacher is doing a poor job. From what I've read, I don't expect other classes to be such a mess though. ",

In a perfect world, I would prefer to trade some of the writing time and spend it on the optional reading assignments instead. To illustrate the volume, the word count heuristics from the teaching team led to about 15k words in total across all the assignments. I recommend front loading and starting with a strong, steady pace early in the semester. \n\nThe work included a mix of written assignments, code/applied projects, project write ups, exams, and peer feedback. This mixture resulted in a nice balance to the grading, with no one assignment making up the bulk of the course grade. The balance of broad topical coverage with more deep dives in the assignments was also good. \n\nThe teaching team was really great, and the feedback and grades on assignments were returned in a very timely manner.

By the end of it, you learn an amazing amount of material. I seem to be in a minority, but I felt the embedded quizzes were great (despite typos & errors) and really helped to reinforce the course material. You can always hit the skip to answer button if you run into trouble. You got credit for just attempting the quizzes. \n\nThere is a partner option for the last two projects which was great. That became an important channel of communication for working out issues that were not addressed via Piazza. \n\nGenerally positive -- I quite enjoyed the project and felt like the effort level involved was quite reasonable (8-15 hours). If you cannot read C++ or figure out undocumented code you will have trouble. This is a real academic simulator, written by people just trying to get things done; commenting was a secondary concern. The actual coding you do is 20-50 lines, the trouble is just figuring out where they go. Having read horror stories about multi-hour simulations from prior terms, I was pleasantly surprised that the simulations took only a couple of minutes. \n\nThe Major issue (as stated by others) -- was the Piazza interaction with the professor & TAs. Office hours were cancelled for a few weeks, then disappeared altogether. Logistics around projects and exams were poorly communicated. Halfway through the semester instructor (professor / and especially TA) participation fell off a cliff. Shockingly, there was no formal announcement for the Final Exam!\n\nOverall -- the content is great, but be prepared to have to figure things out on your own. Make sure you take the lab partner option as he/she will be one of the best resources to resolve issues that you are unable to post publicly to Piazza. ",

Bomb a test, and it could drop you a letter grade. \n- Projects: Not much assistance was offered, and if you got stuck on a coding issue, not much help was available (except from Piazza, see above)\nTIPS for the CLASS:\nIf you are thinking about taking this class, here are some useful tips:\n- PYTHON - make sure you have good Python programming skills. If not, you will struggle with the projects. The class assumes you can write Python programs. \n- If you didn't take an undergraduate Networking class, consider getting the suggested textbook: Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach. This was helpful\n- Attend (or watch afterwards) all the Office Hours - very helpful and critical to my passing the class (professor gives good hints on the tough test questions)\n- Read all the posts on Piazza. Again this provided hints and details on tough test questions. \n- And don't forget to have fun!",

The class gives you a taste of what it might mean to implement machine learning algo in real life - the frustration and uncertainty. If you stick with the course, you will be rewarded! I thought about quitting half-way through the class and received a C on the first homework BUT ended up with an A in the final course. \n\nThere are opportunities for \"extra credit\", where you can show that you have done extra work and get potential lift points if you're in between grades - it is not clear how this is done but it worked to my benefit. The class is very open about sharing algorithms (but not write ups) and discussion boards are full of people exchanging ideas and helping students that are stuck. Very collaborative class and it promotes open sources and sharing in the CS community. Also, I appreciated peer feedback because then I could see how other approached the same question & with different languages. \n\nThis class took over my life for a few months but I am a stronger technical person as a result.

The two midterms for 2015 fall is hard and the mean is below 80, however the final is quite easy and most of the questions are the same in the two midterms. So my got an A at last... Such a surprise... \nIf you want to get an A without many hardwork, don't take this course. If you like chanllege yourself with a theoretical course, it is an interesting one to try. \n\nIf I read this unofficial suyvey before registering my first semester's classes, I wouldn't chanllege myself.... It was so hard and almost painful to me. ",

            "text": "I really enjoyed this class. It helped me develop a good understanding of networking and I thought Prof Lillethun and the TAs did a really good job. I got a pretty high mark in this class (97), so I thought I would share a couple of tips that might help others that are planning to take it:\n\n1. As mentioned in the other reviews, some of the questions on the quizzes can be vague and easily misinterpreted. My approach on the quizzes was to make sure I researched each question throughly, considered all possible interpretations, and if necessary, post a private message to the Instructors requesting clarification. I tried to ensure my questions were concise, clear (sighting examples where possible), and demonstrated that I understood the related material throughly. In my experience, Prof Lillethun and the TAs were forthright and always willing to clarify things. \n\n2. Use office hours effectively! Office hours are your opportunity to speak to the Prof about the material and get answers and direction on homework, quizzes, and projects. The Instructors were willing to put a lot of time into the office hours, so take advantage of it. \n \n3. In advance of the quiz, they provide homework questions and answers. The homework answers are very useful on the quizzes. Use them. \n\n4. T-square sucks. When you answer a question that accepts multiple answers, do not guess at an answer. Incorrect choices will be deducted from any correct choices. So be conservative. Don't gamble on choices that you aren't sure of. \n \n5. T-square sucks. Make sure you record your answers and back them up on your computer. \n\n6. The projects aren't very hard, but you do need to have *some basic* programming. experience. If this isn't you, you might as well use this course to begin developing that experience (because Python is a good first language to learn, and you will certainly need it on other courses in the program). Prepare for the class by learning how to use basic data structures (maps, lists, sets), write methods, and declare variables. This is basic stuff, but a number of people seemed unprepared. ",

            "text": "This course is both very challenging and interesting. The word \"introductory\" in the title can be quite misleading. When I took this course, I presumed that the course teaches OpenMP and MPI. It doesn't. You are required to study these as part of the course and use them in solving the assignments. The course focuses more on algorithms and divided into 3 parts:\n\n1. Shared memory parallelism (OpenMP)\n2. Distributed memory parallelism (MPI)\n3. Cache based optimizations\n\nLectures: The course content is very good, but may require multiple readings/viewings before it can be assimilated. This was my 5th course, and my toughest so far. The instructor is hilarious. His jokes are very creative and funny and perhaps compensate for the heavy lecture material. \n\nAssignments: There are a total of 5 assignments. Of these 3 are reasonable. 2 are very tough (There are students who spent more than 40-50 hrs on an assignment and still couldn't complete it). If you get an assignment to work you get about 80-90% credit. The remaining 10-20% goes for performance improvements. The problem is that if you don't get the assignment to work, you lose big time. And that can be harsh, because many students spend most of their time just getting it to work. Do not underestimate the assignments and start early. Also, you need to be comfortable with C, C++ (especially pointer handling). Without this you will struggle in implementing some assignments. \n\nMidterms/Final exam: These can be quite tough. The midterm had a class average of around 19/50. The final exam had a class average of about 29/50. You have to be really well versed in the course content to do well in the exams. \n\nGrading: I do not know the exact grade distribution but based on the numbers shown on this website, the percentage of A's seem to be the lowest among current courses while the number of C's seemed to be the highest compared to current courses. Not the course to take if you want to get away with an easy grade. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you are interested in knowing more about HPC algorithms and are willing to work hard.

Thrun, is considered one of the pioneers in his field and has a unique teaching style. Also, the TAs were really helpful and know their stuff. \n\nThe class is divided into two parts (lectures with homework) and (two projects). The first part of the course is pretty straight forward. The second part has two projects: the first is the runaway project which involves some linear algebra. The second project is pretty open where you are free to implement any of the algorithms taught in the course to solve the problem. You can also use any other algorithm you want as long as you mention that in your report and say why you used that. \n\nTo prepare, I advise:\n1. having a python prior experience (Udacity: Intro to CS is a good refresher). \n2. Artificial Intelligence experience (briefly skimming through Udacity's Intro to AI lectures can be helpful)",

Before touching this class I would look at being able to write both Python and Scala. In addition, familiarity with Vagrant and general Linux admin tasks are pretty mandatory. Finally, if it's been a while since you've taken an advanced statistics course, you should look into that-- you'll be expected to derive some pretty advanced formulas (partial derivatives included) and implement them in code. If you have these prereqs, then learning the Hadoop and Spark ecosystems shouldn't be too bad. Do not take with another high-load class (like IOS, ML, or CCA). ",

The lectures and assigned text are not adequate and need to be updated to reflect the heavier math and proof focus of the course. There is wide variation in the grading and a simple mistake followed by a completely correct proof can land you with a huge penalty. I decided to drop the course before the first exam because I wasn't getting enough out of the course to continue to go through the extremely draining process of keeping up with their pacing and assignments for another 10 weeks. Will get more learning the material at my own pace. Instructor interaction with students is good - best so far in the program, but still not adequate for the level of mastery they expect of students. Need more modeling and scaffolding. Not too much to expect in an intro grad course. ",

Based on other reviews, many students thought the math in this course was challenging. It is basic freshman/sophomore calculus, but a lot of people didn't come into this program with that. If you consider yourself a math person, take Andrew Ng's classes on Stanford Engineering Everywhere. That's what real Machine Learning looks like, not the plug-and-chug coding of this course. \n\nIn this course you will get a lot of practice running algorithms that are poorly explained. I have a math / physics background and am floored by how superficial -- yet still time-consuming -- the total coverage, problem sets, and exams were. The questions involve running algorithms and interpreting output, which is about as crank-turning as I could imagine. Still, it takes a lot of time to do because the tools (except Weka) are weak and the lectures exceedingly hand-wavy. I found the book much more clear (though dry) in its explanations than the lectures. Neither were helpful on any of the assignments. Basically if you're modestly good at Java (or expertly good with Python and R ML libraries) and have a lot of time to learn to use APIs for existing ML tools, then you're fine. Perhaps that's what all CS courses are like?",

Granted, I took it the first semester it was offered in OMS so I was expecting some issues with course content, coordination, and communication. However, it was much worse than I expected and I decided to drop the class and possibly come back to it in a future semester if I get the sense things have improved. This could be a really good class but, as it was, I spent 95% of my time hacking and 5% learning which is not a good educational return on my time. Some things to know or review prior to this class: SQL (particularly joins), how to derive equations , Vagrant VM. Also, be aware that you will be using newer data tools and technologies which could be very valuable to learn but good documentation seemed to be very lacking and the labs barely scratched the surface of what you will need to know to get through the homework. I would strongly recommend taking this class on its own. ",

Projects are expected to be completed so quickly you often don't have time to actually learn the tools you're using. The labs don't teach you anything beyond how to copy the code snippets the professor gives you, and the lectures have essentially nothing to do with the projects. It's a pity, because this class seems so interesting in theory, but the execution is remarkably poor.

More or less, we've all done all of the first 2 projects, and then just met to combine for the best answer. Easily one of the easier courses in the program, though there is a little interesting material and I hope the last section will be a little more involved.

Others in Piazza have noted that the marks gained in each segment of the assignments are not weighed with the amount of time used solving them - I believe this is correct and to be honest I'm totally fine with that. \n\nI think anyone taking this course will learn alot and is well worthwhile. \n\nTop tips:\n\n* Review AI topics beforehand (use google to find the syllabus)\n* Knowledge of Numpy/Python would help\n* Taking ML first would naturally make the ML portions easier... \n\nI don't think there's really any course that I would say should be done as a prerequisite for the AI course, and would work fine as a first course.

Sharing resulting images on Piazza has been really very helpful for me. \n\n(Update)\nTowards the end of the course, I got really burned out I stopped trying to arrive at the best parameters. My PS grades suffered. My final grade could have recovered by performing well in the final exam, but I was really too tired. When I looked at the exam feedback, I realized most of my mistakes were just because I misread them, but I actually know the answer. Not that the questions are not worded clearly, I was really just blurring out already when I was taking the exam. Looking back, though, maybe my fallout could have been much earlier if not for my supportive classmates. I did not appreciate early on the virtue of having Piazza graded, but I guess it helped in making students vocal and more active in providing support to each other. On the other hand, just a little more push could have given me an A. So my advice to those who will take this: do not give up. It is doable. Very difficult, but doable. And allocate your energy well, you will need it until the end. ",

The course is very manageable as all materials are in Udacity and are available right from the start. The video lectures are very easy to follow, however I feel that I need to do some work outside from what the course requires for the knowledge to be ingrained. \n\n(Update)\nSomeone asked if you get to learn more advanced techniques in AI4R... \nI am a total noob, so everything is advanced to me... I guess it is how you make of it. The course gives you many opportunities to learn more advanced techniques, but you can complete the course satisfactorily (I guess) without doing so. \n Throughout the lectures and the problem sets, it feels like you are being assisted like a 5 year-old: everything is well explained, you wouldn't notice much if you do not have a good grip. The problem sets are scored as all or nothing, but the answers are also provided so it seems to be just a matter of having tried or not tried. If you want to get more advanced, materials for advanced study are also provided, but it would not really hurt if you do not glance over them. It is easy to get complacent, until you get to the Runaway Robot and the Final Project, which are really challenging. You really needed to take a big leap, read a lot more and explore other possible algorithms to solve the problem. Most of my classmates talk about using an algorithm not even discussed in the lectures for solving the Final Project. \n\n The TAs are very helpful. They do their best to up the participation, even create interesting videos every week. When somebody asks questions, they are quick to dive in. And when they do, they do not just answer: they give expounded explanations like how things might be different for other cases. But this course can actually be done even without interaction with others, so Piazza is sort of quiet. ",

When the professor designed the course, I doubt he realized how time-consuming it would actually be. \n\nIt took me 2-2. 5x as much time as Machine Learning (7641) did. As mentioned below, the time-spent-to-amount-learned ratio is not very good. I probably spent about 5% of the time actually learning and 95% of the time hacking away / throwing everything against the wall to get something to work. Many classmates had similar feelings. \n\nOne of the (4) homeworks took me about 12 hours just to get the very first part correct - worth 5 points; and that step was necessary to move on with the rest of the assignment. On another assignment I was stuck on the first section for an entire week and spent around 30 hours trying to figure out what was wrong. The students on Piazza and the TAs are helpful, but when you are truly stuck, too bad - you'll get a bad grade. What's worse is that the TAs don't share the correct solutions with you afterwards. Because of this, I feel like there's a lot I didn't take away from the class. \n\nThe class frequently has guest lecturers, which seem extremely interesting. Unfortunately, the instructors never shared any of the videos past March 1st, so the majority of talks were never shared with OMSCS students. Students asked about this on Piazza (several times) with no response from the teaching team. \n\nThe final project is enjoyable, but my mentor didn't make things easy. For the project, my mentor was supposed to upload a large. csv file to a Postgres database, but 2 days before the due date he still couldn't get it working -- which led to me having to re-write a significant portion of my code. I spent about 20 hours debugging this, but still couldn't get it working - because of that, I was forced to use a smaller dataset (which I'll be punished for). \n\nThis course has a lot of potential, but desperately needs to be re-designed and have the professor more actively involved.

            "text": "TL;DR: This is a fascinating class, but seriously consider taking it by itself. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Fascinating topics (OpenMP, MPI, caching)\n-Dr. Vuduc keeps the lectures lighthearted and interesting. \n-You get 2 \"48 hour\" late passes to turn projects in late with full credit. \n-You get a \"48 hour make your performance better\" period if you don't like where your grade is after they're released. This only applies if you actually turned something in though. They take the top result, so you don't need to worry about your grade going down. \n-The Piazza forum is active (with both the TAs and Dr. Vuduc replying). \n-Grading is fair. \n\nTHE BAD:\n-The projects take a SIGNIFICANT amount of time. Even with a very good knowledge of C/C++ I found that I was still spending 30-40+ hours on each project (except for lab0). Heed what others are saying. Do *not* wait till the weekend they're due. \n-The Udacity \"autograder\" can be a complete pain in the behind. At times the output isn't very helpful on why it failed. On top of that, the TAs generally don't expound upon what the grader is actually testing. Depending on the project, you can spend a significant amount of time just passing the autograder. \n-The projects have *roughly* a two week cadence. So you're always going to be working on something for this class (circle back to comment in the TL;DR). \n-Office hours aren't consistent. We'll have one every week and then nothing for 2-3 weeks. \n\nTHE UGLY:\nThe class averaged 23. 8/50 on the midterm and it was curved to being out of 40. While they didn't have to curve at all; this meant the majority of the class got a D or lower on the exam. Some of us were disappointed that last semester the average was 19/50 and it was curved to out of 30. To be fair though, two people got above 40 which is what likely \"broke\" the curve. \n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS:\n-Have a good working knowledge of C/C++. Especially pointers. \n-Go to (or watch) the office hours. \n-Give the class the time it needs. ",

The video lectures are interesting, funny and clear, they are truly great lectures. However, I found the TA-ing not to be involved enough or maybe the flow of information itself was not enough. \n\nThe workload is quite heavy, there were a few assignments I spent 20+ hours on (just the coding itself). Grading is okay, though the requirements are not always 100% clear. Also the workload distribution is not even so be sure to jump into the assignments very early on, especially the first few. Another downside of the heavy workload that the TAs can't always keep up the pace either, some assignments took quite long to return and we had to submit at least 3 assignments before we got our first feedback. All these result in a lot of noise on Piazza, you have to go through 10K+ posts on piazza during the semester if you want to keep up. \n\nThey dropped MATLAB Fall2015, from now on you can only do your homework in Python. And unless you are good at Python (including advanced things like optimization and parallelization in NumPy), you'll spend a few nights debugging for sneaky bugs or screaming over algorithms that run for 40 minutes. \n\nAll in all: it is a good class but there is a room for some improvement. The material is great, the assignments are hard but rewarding. ",

He more or less establishes a standard (most consider it on the overzealous side of the spectrum) and grades accordingly. It is rather appalling to take a course where the instructor doesn't instruct, the lectures are given by a previous instructor and TA, but they aren't always on target with the course requirements and the level of rigor that is required, the instructors are somewhat responsive on the forum (the only clsas contact is via Piazza), office hours are explicitly NOT conducted, and NO outside resources or collaboration are allowed on homework! Basically, self-teach, but you're not even allowed differing perspectives to help really solidify what the student is supposed to learn. Sure, there are problem sets that are circulated that students are allowed to collaborate on and use outside resources for, but there really isn't much time to do those if focusing on the required homeworks first. Also, it's more miss than hit that the instructor will provide solutions to the practice problems to know if you're getting it or not. If you're up for a quite hefty challenge that definitely is a psychological one as well, go for it, but know it will be rough. It's fairly demoralizing, and I've taken undergrad algorithms, theory, discrete math and proofs within the past 7 years! There were some changes between this past fall and the present semester, but unless they make MAJOR changes to where this course is actually taught and supported, I'd recommend going with the II specialization unless you're determined to struggle for the specialization you really want. I understand it's a tough subject and students should expect a challenge, especially from an institution like GA Tech, but the department really should evaluate their strategy for this one. Also, check the instructor's reviews prior to the program... not very positive previously w/ other subjects!",

The class covers a wide swathe of the machine learning spectrum. The lectures themselves don't get too deep, but they do a good job of familiarizing you with a lot of concepts. \n\nThere is quite a bit of supplemental reading, both with the primary text and several other papers. Not so much as AOS had, but still a fair amount. \n\nProfessor Isbell and the TAs are pretty responsive on Piazza. Elijah has been very active and helpful in particular. \n\nThe bulk of the difficulty comes with the projects. They are very open ended: you can use whatever data sets or framework you want to complete them. All of the coding and experimentation is just a set up for the analysis you write, which is the real centerpiece of a project. Writing a good analysis requires really understanding what is going on and will require a fair amount of independent research, above and beyond what the lectures and supplemental reading provide. It's tough, but I find that it gives a thorough understanding of the area. For me each of the projects has taken around 50-60 hours to complete. They come at a two to three week cadence. Budget your time appropriately. \n\nFor some of the projects it is likely that you will end up using ABAGAIL, which is maintained by Pushkar. It's pretty solid, although it has some blemishes. My only complaint with it is that there are standing bugs in it which are fixed by several-month-old pull requests. You can go and find these yourself, but they really should be merged. \n\nI've only had the midterm so far, and I must admit it is probably one of the hardest I've ever had. It is intentionally hard. My understanding is not that it is meant to weed people out, but to separate the truly outstanding students. \n\nOverall, if you like machine learning and you're willing to take on a tough course, I highly recommend this one.

Most problems probably due to first time offering\n\nIt's best to think of these class as seminar where the lectures are really only a cursory review of the material but you are then expected to do independent research to implement the assignments. (One assignment involving MCMC is covered in the lecture for only 90 seconds). Unlike many classes where the starter code provides a lot of the minutia functionality, this class you pretty much build from the ground up. The starter code when provided is sparsely documented and seems hastily prepared. Got the impression that each TA was assigned the task of creating one homework for the class, but then those assignments weren't tested or validated by the other TAs/Instructor prior to launch. In many of the other classes, (like Intro to CV or KBAI) the assignments, while hard, show polish from having been refined over the years rather than being rushed to meet production deadline. \n\nThe biggest problem though is that after an assignment, there's no follow up by staff as to what the right approach or solution might have been. Didn't get it solved? Too bad. Students aren't allowed to share solutions or general approaches after the fact either. Makes it hard to learn if you struggle with an assignment but then get no feedback other than a grade. There was discussion of this being due to Piazza. Hopefully on future iterations the TAs/Staff will figure out how to lock it down so that they don't have to worry about future students finding the previous class forums. \n\nApparently the curve is generous, so supposedly everybody will be getting Bs or As. I was getting a high A when I dropped. I dropped because of the lack of feedback. \n\nI'm optimistic that future iterations will work a lot of the 'first-time-offered' bugs out. ",

The lectures are incredibly well done and are interspersed with actual good humor by Prof. Vudoc. The projects are all very interesting. There are 5 of them and I've spent about 20 hours on each. I could have spent double that time optimizing them, but my efforts were good enough to get close to 95% on most. \n\nThe midterm was brutally hard.

The staff acts as if this is a favor to the students to keep pushing out the dates, but it makes it extremely hard to know what's going on with the course. On top of that, they promise that assignments and documents will be released by certain dates and VERY consistently actually release them several days later (and often push the due dates out in response). \n\nThe lectures are fine. They do a pretty good job of covering the current healthcare situation in the US and different IT solutions/problems to these. Every 2-3 weeks another little quiz is due that tests whether or not you've watched the lectures - I can mostly ignore these until they're due, watch the group of lectures on fast forward in less than an hour, and then take the (open book/notes) quiz using the lecture transcripts for reference. The amount of useful knowledge I feel like I gain from the lectures is minimal. \n\nThe project is ill-defined and we have been able to receive little useful feedback from the assigned TA. It doesn't help anything that the grades and feedback for each assigned deliverable is extremely late (you get feedback from the last assignment nearly by the time the next one is due) and not-at-all detailed. It's hard to know if the project is going in a reasonable direction for a solid grade. *shrug* I guess we'll see. \n\nThere was supposed to be some interesting programming exercises for working with FHIR. This was updated to be some quizzes instead. Apparently, they thought the Masters Computer Science students were too incompetent to figure out some programming exercises. \n\nGaTech really needs to reevaluate this one...

Alex also has office hours every week where you can ask more questions if you have them. The course material is well laid out, the assignments are easy to understand what is required, and the lectures are well done. \n\nNow for the not so good:\n\n* This course is easy. I have only a sliver of a Java background, and this was enough to get through the paper just fine. \n* This course covers things like using an IDE and git. If you're a working programmer like myself, you will probably already know this. \n* The grading on the group assignments is focused on the paperwork you produce, not the code. We turned in an assignment that failed half the instructor tests and still got an 80 or 85. \n* There is a significant amount of group work in this paper. I was in a different time zone to my colleagues and ended up doing 6am meetings most of the time. \n* I didn't really enjoy the material. The course is about the software development process, not coding, and it covers a lot of tools that aren't relevant to me as a working programmer, e. g. UML, Rational Unified Process, e. t. c. However this is the point of the course so I shouldn't be too surprised :)\n\nOverall, this is a good paper to take if you're new to OMSCS and want an easier paper to start with, to learn the ropes of taking papers. If you've already met your foundational requirement, and aren't interested in more enterprisey processes, and are looking for challenging papers, then I wouldn't recommend this one. However I must emphasise again, how well Alex and the TA's run this course. ",

A lot of mysteries in ML for me are answered in this class. I tend to disagree with other people about the assignments though...

I do wish them to separate these into two-semester long course so we could go deeper in some of the topics or maybe open a follow-up advanced level course though. \n\nThe piazza is really active, almost too active that I could barely follow, but I guess that's always good.

The videos are pretty straight forward, and you have to know videos and papers for the TESTS. We only had 2 tests, but were supposed to have many----next semester I think they will do more. The projects were cool and interesting(know your Python), once you figured out how to get started. That might be my one recommendation is that sometimes we really had no idea how to get started. They definitely expect the \"figuring it out\" part is the first step of each project and is crucial to understanding. The autograders were a bit scary, cause even when you got the project working, you were worried whether your project would pass or not. Our last project has an autograder we had access to, so we knew for sure. Hopefully that will become the norm. My advice, the projects are very doable if you start early. Those who waited really seemed to panic at the end. TA (esp Michael) were extremely communicative in Piazza, so use that site daily for questions and updated. The course looks like they are redesigning, so there is definitely some re-ordering that needs to be done between readings, quizzes, and projects. But, overall good course with appropriate level of time commitment. ",

The projects were simple and typically didn't require much effort assuming basic Python knowledge; Less than 2 hours each. I would've expected the projects to be more challenging considering my undergraduate Computer Networks class involved implementing a subset of functionality for an FTP server in C, given only the RFC document. The exams, of which there were 2, were typical memorize and regurgitate style with multiple choice and free response questions through ProctorTrack. \n\nThe content did not fit what I expected from a Computer Networks class. It seemed to be a hodge podge of select topics in the computer networking realm. I honestly didn't get much out of the class. \n\nIf you want an easy class and are ok with the typical memorize and regurgitate style of exams, then this is the class for you. ",

It took me a bit more time than the others simply because I was confused as to what I was doing. \n\nMidterm was not difficult, all true/false and multiple choice questions. You can only answer them one at a time, so that was annoying because you could not go back and double check. The questions were similar to the Quizzes, but some of the questions did get me. \n\nI should mention this is my first class in the program and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is new and thinking about taking it.

The lectures were actually pretty good throughout the first half of the course but became more technical and less well explained during the second. The projects were not difficult, but I don't feel that they added anything to my understanding of the concepts. \n\nThe major problem I had with this course was the quizzes. The multiple choice questions were loaded with ambiguous answers, which still seemed ambiguous after watching the lectures multiple times and scouring Google for information. It often felt like you were left with 2 or 3 equally plausible choices and then forced to make a guess. There were multiple times where I felt like I actually, thoroughly understood what the question was asking and how each of the answers worked, but still had to just guess which was the \"best\" answer. \n\nThe free response questions weren't as tricky, but only gave you 90-120 words to explain your solution. There were 2 times in the beginning where I was penalized for not including all the information - I knew the information that I had left out, I tried to imply it in the response as much as possible, but didn't know how to get it all in there given the short answer length. I felt like I was being penalized not because of my understanding, but because of some weird artificial limitation. After this, rather than trying to explain my solution, I wrote down shorter jargon filled answers that, truthfully, I sometimes didn't fully understand and ended up getting full credit. This to me seems like a flaw - it felt to me that the grade was less about understanding and more about memorization. \n\nThis may be a harsh review, but I really didn't like this class. ",

The 2nd project, which turned about to be the longest, took me about 60 hours to complete. The math and linear algebra can be intimidating, and if it wasn't for the community on Piazza I don't think I would have figured out how to do certain things. As difficult as it is, the grading is very honest and the TAs are extremely helpful - if you put in the effort you will succeed. \n\nThis is a very challenging course but it is 100% worth it. I would HIGHLY recommend learning numpy and at least brushing up on opencv basics before taking this course. I think a better understanding of numpy and \"vectorization\" in particular would have saved me a ton of headache in the first half of the course.

Mainly had to drop because a newborn and toddler in the house made it almost impossible to get any work done. \n\nThat said, this class had a lot of required reading. Not the most interesting material to read through but it is scientific papers so be prepared to read papers several times. I think on average there were 3-4 papers per week. The first project seemed reasonable but a lot like the projects in IOS (which I took Fall 2015 and did very well in). You will fight with the autograder a lot and instructions were fairly vague. Good help from Piazza though. \n\nFrom looking ahead before I dropped there is A LOT of material you are tested on in the midterm/final study guides that comes directly from the papers. This might be the reason that the test grades are so low. \n\nI was excited to take the course but after spending just over a month in the course I'm glad I dropped it. Definitely information overload from the papers and trying to digest those left me exhausted when tackling the project. If the instructor trimmed down the readings a bit so you could focus on the lecture material and projects (where you actually learn IMHO) then this could be a good class. Until then I will not be signing up again. ",

Most of the assignments were fun, interesting, and not overwhelmingly challenging. I wasn't crazy about the group projects because there's always a roll of the dice with the quality of your teammates, but it mostly worked out ok. \n\nThere is one major problem with the class, though: they were extremely ineffective and providing timely feedback for assignments. We had weekly assignments and in many cases it was over a month between submission and when the grades were released. This made the assignments quite a bit less effective than they could have been. Every week the head TA made commitments about when we'd get our next wave of grades back and he virtually never followed through on those commitments. Were it not for this significant shortcoming, I'd say the class was outstanding. ",

It is likely that subsequent semesters will have more paper-reproduction projects and less MS-style homework assignments. \n\nFinally, this course doesn't have as much instructor involvement as ML does.

The workload was probably lower in the second half. Also, there is lots of extra credit available throughout the class. It seems a sizeable amount of students did not finish all of the assignments, but if you do, there is a good chance you can get >100%. \n\nThere is not much info in the lectures, but there is some good info in the labs. The professor wants students to learn by doing. Personally, I agree that this is the best way to learn (by trying to tackle something I am not quite sure how to do yet), but I can understand some students preferring a more structured approach, where they are told more explicitly how to do what they need to do. I would say the most important skill in this class is just to be a quick learner. \n\nOverall, I learned more in this class than any other I have taken. I would recommend this class if you have any interest in using big data tools. Just don't expect an easy class. I would probably take this class by itself or paired with an easier class. ",

The lectures were very well done and he gives you just about everything you need to know to trudge and sweat your way through the exams.

If the exam questions were more straightforward, I would be happier with this class overall. Do not try to cheat your way through this class. He will run your code through a plagarism detection system (MOSS). I didn't cheat, but it still stressed me out a lot that there were announcements saying people who cheated should confess or be reported to the dean. I would always worry that the system might flag my submission as a false positive when it was analyzed. This is probably the second most stressful class I've taken in the program. If I knew what I was getting into with this one, I probably would have just taken something else. The topics covered were far from what I was expecting. I wish they would break this into 2 classes... One for testing and one for analysis. I don't think I gained much personal benefit from the analysis part and very little useful knowledge from the testing part... Overall, a thumbs down from me.

You spend most of the time figuring out how to encode Turing machines or theorizing about esoteric mathematical graph properties, both of very little use for computer scientists. The instructor really didn't do much throughout the entire class. His attitude is either you already know the material and you'll pass, or if you don't he can't really teach it to you. The lectures (prepared by another instructor) don't really give you the background needed to solve the homework or the exams as set by the current instructor. You mostly have to make up your own curriculum and hope that what you studied gives you the math background needed to barely pass this class. I don't recommend taking this class until they change the current instructor or he changes the way it's taught.

They would deduct huge amounts of points for trivial, ridiculous, or even subjective reasons. \n\nThey would also derive requirements from posts between students, or from optional office hours (note: there was a special requirements interview office hours, and I'm not referring to that one) and then grade against those arbitrary requirements, which I found to be rather uncalled for and unbelievable. \n\nThere's a lot of group work, and every week some project or assignment will be due, so the workload is very consistent, you will be putting in hours towards this class every single week for the full semester. Take this into account if you have a lot of business trips or plan to take any additional courses while taking this one. \n\nFor the good:\nThe lecture videos are some of the best I've seen at GA Tech and the android application development was really fun, plus there were consistent office hours on google hangouts every week.

            "text": "Unlike some others who have stated this class was super easy, I will contrast and state I thought it was very challenging. I would not consider it hard, but it was very time consuming, especially toward the end. The first several weeks are no more than a few hours week. After the midterm, the projects get very difficult and toward the end, I was spending upward of 40 hours a week working on them. The first few assignments are very much 'hand holding' to give you direction. The last few are much more like real world programming assignments where you are given a task without much direction and have to figure out how to do it. Expect to spend lots of time Googling. \n\nThe first half of the class was easy as it slowly allowed you piece by piece to assemble the final projects. The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week. \n\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch's book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, 'IBM']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam. \n\nOverall I really did like the class. I have an interest in the stock market, so the material was right up my alley. If you find finance boring you will likely not get as much out of it. Make sure you have at least intermediate level Python skills. Brush up on Numpy and Pandas before taking the class and you will do well. ",

Although the instructor says all the quiz answers can be derived from the slides, I think some of that is a far stretch. I feel it is easier to personally fill in the gaps through reading the textbook. \n- Projects were enjoyable and challenging. There were four in total. The third was a new one in this semester that had a lot of technical issues and bugs. I don't think it was an appropriate project to ask students to test out a smartphone app. Fortunately, there was an alternative option for that project (which was a literature project and designing a smartphone app that uses pki). \n- Bonus extra credit was available if you complete additional problems related to a project. \n- Exams were fair. Multiple choice and T/F on proctortrack. \n- Professors and TAs were helpful. They even held office hours almost everyday in the week!

If you're not comfortable with matrices and their operations some of the projects will be difficult. Projects 2 (hough), 6 (optical flow), and 7 (particle filters) were the most challenging and time consuming. The final was open book/notes and covered all sections of the lecture. It wasn't difficult if you covered all of the lectures and mostly stuck to higher level questions than minutiae. The one thing I really disliked about this class, and computer vision in general, is the parameter tuning/fitting.

I felt that the two person teaching format worked really well for the course, to the point where I started to question why all courses didn't do this. It sort of reminded me of the back and forth in a RadioLab podcast. This was one of the best classes I've ever taken, and even though I have some background in Machine Learning, I felt I took away a lot of new insights from this course. \n\nIs it hard? I guess. I don't feel that it's hard to get a \"B\", but you have to work at it. I think the professor recognizes your efforts and as long as you are committed to learning the material (proving it by doing all the assignments and problem sets), then you should get at least a B. Another way to put it is that if you didn't get a B in this class, you probably weren't that surprised about it. \n\nIn terms of criticisms, this was my first course in OMSCS, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Certainly there seems to be a fair amount of growing pains in the program itself when it comes to addressing student concerns or giving out grades on time. But it also seems that the administrators recognize this and actively try to improve the environment for everyone. Over time I think some of these hiccups will iron itself out. A second criticism is that the book they recommend is a bit antiquated, given the level to which this field has evolved. It would have been nice if they upgraded to ESL or something similar. \n\nOverall though, I'm very happy that I took this course. ",

I personally did not have much big data experience but by the time I completed the homework assignments I was ready to design and implement a large scale experiment on Hadoop for my project without major issues. \n\nOn the negative side, the lectures and other course content are pretty thin. There was a fairly large gap between content the course provides and what was needed to actually complete the assignments, so most of what I learned in the course was through looking up tutorials and other course materials on the Internet. By far the biggest negative was the workload required for the first three homework assignments, I spent at least 40+ hours per week on the assignments over the six weeks that were given to complete them. The assignments themselves were not necessarily difficult to complete (although one assignment required deriving an equation used throughout the rest of the assignment which the course itself in no way prepares you for), but it's very much as if an entire semester's worth of assignments are crammed into that first part of the course. There were some other minor negatives to the course, mostly in the form of the course being disorganized and instructions being vague or conflicting. \n\nOverall I would say this could be a great course and I personally learned a lot from it, but I can't recommend it in its current form.

I don't know how you all managed that, but this shows the dedication with which you all work and value your job. Congratulations!\n \nAny feedback without mentioning the lecture videos would, to me, be unfair. For ML videos to be not boring is a monumental task, but I, and I think remaining class shares this sentiment, rather enjoyed them and would listen to them in extended sessions. So, Congatulations on that too!\n \nThe assignments about 80/85% of the time are well managed and well explained, with a clear rubric set for students to meet. In comparison to other better-managed classes, I'd rate this aspect of the class up there with the best. \n \nOn the improvement side, I'd personally like to see following:\nMid-term question creation should be replaced with better directed assignments/projects. I didn't see any value in them. Sorry :(\nSome might not agree with me, but I think first mini-course should be left for students to explore. I'd rather start with Mini Course 2 and ML part immediately afterwards\nRight now, the course gives a touch of ML for Trading systems. I think this leaves room for more \"in-class\" experimentation. Perhaps more algorithms, ideas etc... I'd rank this course from easy-to-medium difficulty; but, I think it should be, with some more directed effort towards ML and its experimentation with Trading systems, medium-to-high difficulty range. \nLecture videos are so good that I would love to see more of them. Other ML algorithms, their analysis etc... Perhaps students don't have to be assigned tasks from them if it becomes too much, but still they can always see them and learn from them in their free time. \n \nI have had great fun with this course, and I hope everyone else has too.

As a qualification, I am of the student build that didn't come with a complete CS background, instead having a degree in IT with an emphasis in programming. However at time of taking this course I have never taken a traditional algorithm and data structure course which the class expects you to come with some knowledge. \n\nThe course surveys different testing tools and ways of deriving analysis. It requires a lot of exploration and research on the student's part which I think is largely why there are many negative reviews because in many instances you were stuck reading through pages of a specific API in order to complete one part of the assignment. For me at least I can say that this has largely made me a better programmer though it feels like a trial by fire. We had a pretty active piazza environment so I was able to make some pretty good strides. However, be aware that the instructor is a stickler for plagiarism, so absolutely it is to your benefit to write your own code by yourself. \n\nThe tests are open book, but it doesn't really help because it will be based more on your ability to apply the knowledge to problems. \n\nClosing statements, this was the first iteration of the course online so there were a couple of speed bumps. I expect that the course will get better with time. ",

The lectures are not the most entertaining ones, but the organization is very good and I had no trouble following through. The assignments and exams focus heavily on application of concepts and problem solving. \n\nEach assignment involves reading the documentation on your own. It sounds intimidating but once you get your hands dirty with some examples, the problems aren't impossible. You can even get away with reading minimal amount of documentation. I'm not sure if the tools you learn in the assignments will be used in your future career, but they do serve the purpose of helping you learn. You'll need some knowledge about Java and at least be able to debug pointer related errors. The exams are difficult but open notes. It involves some tricks and a lot of thinking. \n\nRegarding plagiarism, the solution as simple as \"don't do it\". There's no need to worry that your one-sentence code will most likely be the same as someone else'. The teaching staff know well enough about software testing to avoid false positives. Anti-plagiarism is not your enemy unless you are happy to graduate with students who cheat their way. ",

The course work was way out of balance, with the first half (or so) of the course having almost no work and the last half being heavily loaded. Also, I felt like the list of hundreds of questions to \"study\" for the midterm was counterproductive, as these questions were student written and just generally hard to parse. A lot of my frustration came from Pandas (a python module) which has a really annoying and backwards API and doesn't adhere to the way things are generally done in Python. Overall I spent hours and hours googling ways to do stuff in Pandas, reading piazza, pouring over the assignment docs, etc, which just somehow doesn't feel really rewarding. ",

This course is very helpful in many ways, one of which is that the concepts covered here are used in pretty much every other course (and I've taken 2 others so far). At the end of the day, computer science is a lot about math - not just programming, and understanding the principles behind the programs we write is just as important. I was just as frustrated when taking the course - the countless times I've complained, the near nervous breakdowns and the constant frustration of not being able to solve the assignment problems on my own. However, it's been over a year since I took this course and I am still enjoying the fruits of it. Also, it doesn't matter if you get an A or a B on this course - what matters is how much you learn. To be honest grades don't really dictate success in life anyways. A few things to succeed in this course\n\n1. Be prepared - take some preparatory courses if this is the first time you are taking such a course. There are plenty on Coursera on Design of Algorithms. \n2. Set aside at-least 30 hours a week. If you are working and have a family, ensure that this is the only course you take that term. \n3. Struggle on the assignments - try as hard as you can on each of the problems. But don't be afraid to ask the TAs for hints and to Google for help (don't cheat, but ask for help and cite your references). \n4. The video lectures are not sufficient. Read the textbooks - especially ones recommended for each section. \n5. Solve as many problems as you can - Google for exam papers from other colleges. ",

Picking the right datasets.

The head TA we had, Lallith, did a great job as well. There are numerous positives and I want list them all here other than to say that the positives way out weight the negatives. But will here are my two negatives. \nOne, the third project emphasizes the use of visual viewing of the images which you end up focusing on solving the problem visually instead of utilizing any AI techniques you learned in the class. People with a visual programming background have an advantage on project 3 I think. Note it shouldn't affect your grade to much just feel I spent way more time trying to understand visual programming then I did learning to apply AI techniques on project 3. \nTwo, there is alot of writing and essays. Some of the essay questions become fairly hard to apply using the items you learned in class. Alot of the AI techniques overlap and are fairly theoretical. On top of this, it is graded by a random TA. There is no secondary grader and your scores are left to the arbitrary TA who reviews it. On top of this I had in some cases great detail about why I was scored a certain way and then in others it was a single sentence. There is alot of writing and it spreads the TAs pretty thin but would be nice if a second pair of TA eyes could review a paper. Note, I am not complaining of my score they did a pretty good job but just seems a bit arbitrary. \nThe work load is pretty high and can be made higher depending how much detail you want to give. The instructor is down right amazing and enjoys challenging the students and himself. Overall I highly recommend the class and most will do fine as long as real effort is made. Grade is curved. ",

If you have been a programmer professionally for years and forgotten most of your undergrad then this course will be extremely difficult. The grading in Spring of 2016 was also very opaque and led to some unnecessary challenges. My advice for this class would be:\n\n1. Take this class alone. I am a single guy with no family and I would not want to have taken any other classes with this one. If you have any family I would highly recommend you take this class by itself. \n2. Do not ignore the pre-reqs. Make sure you satisfy all of them before you come in. \n3. This class is very mathy and proof based so be ready for that. I personally really like math and think it has its place inside a Computer Science degree from a research institution, but if you're expecting to be programming a lot you may get caught off guard. \n4. Do not take this class alone, make sure you are on a chat group with other students or very active on Piazza. \n5. Use all of the additional text books, especially if Sipser's is the main text book. I really like Algorithms by Dasgupta\n\nThis course is required for almost all of the specializations right now so you basically have to take it, but do not take it lightly. This course was harder for me than taking two courses in previous semesters and I have a strong math background and took a similar course in my undergrad. ",

I was hoping I would enjoy it more than my undergrad design course (after 14 years on the job). It didn't really turn out that way. As with a lot of courses, the workload varies depending on the assignments due. One thing I didn't care for is the team-based projects. I had a great team and enjoyed working with them but some times it felt like I couldn't really do things on my schedule, so I would have preferred working alone. \n\nThe high point for me was the first project which had an interesting problem not related to software architecture. I had a lot of (stressful) fun trying to figure it out. So I will probably start focusing more on those types of classes. ",

There is usually a \"trick\" involved and once you figured it out things will just click. However, plan on some extra time for the static analysis assignments towards the end of the class. Some of the students spent hours and hours on the last assignment, (Constraint Based Analysis), and the solution is surprisingly concise at about 20 lines of code. \n\nThe midterm and final were pretty difficult. On the midterm there was a generous curve and the instructors said that there will be a similar one for the final. The material comes from the lectures and is expanded upon. I would recommend watching each lecture twice; once before doing the corresponding homework and once before the test. Also, plan on re-taking quizzes using pencil and paper when watching for the second time (since you can't blank out previous submissions on Udacity). ",

Agree with comments I have read so far and I'll add my take. \n\nClass spends one third teaching you Python/Numpy/Pandas. Professor already indicated that will shrink that part. I'd feel torn at leaving it out. I had already taken the ML class and had to decide by myself if to learn R or Python while at the same time going through lectures and that was painful. So overall I'm on the side of leaving that part in but shortening it. \n\nI loved that professor asked to implement everything ourselves without relying to any library (other than numpy/pandas). There's nothing like implementing an algorithm yourself. Even something as simple as KNN has its tricks when implementing it. \n\nI loved that the assignments were somehow at par with the class. Every assignment is an increment over the last one. You get to build your own market simulator (or backtester). Stock trading strategies and then ML algorithms for it. \n\nProfessor was incredibly engaged throughout the class. He hosts several hangouts of an hour or more himself. He's amazingly active in piazza. Piazza becomes a firehose of posts and the professor replied to at least one third of them with followups. \n\nIf there would be a second part for this class I'd definitely sign up!",

Most of the comments already here describe the experience well, so I'll concentrate on advice. \n1) Study the prereqs specified for the course, but don't expect for a moment that will get you by. Read the assigned textbook for the course (Sipser) and try, try, try to understand it before you attempt the course (yes, all of it). If you don't, you will not likely do well in this course. Use the Internet to help your understanding of the material (watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation video series). \n2) The teaching/videos in the class are terrible. Sadly, most of the stuff I found on the Internet presents the material in the exact same way. Your best bet? Find a group to work with to help you try and understand the material. And really try to understand it, because you will need to turn in homework that is based on your own thoughts. Additionally, your group will not be there to help you on the exams. \n3) Your grade is based on you and you alone. You will not get a good grade just because you did better than a certain percentage of the class. If that what you need to succeed, this class is not for you. \n4) Don't expect to ever know how you truly stand in the class. Grading (under the current grading style) is very vague and inconsistent. If the thought of this drives you crazy, stay far away. \n5) If you feel you are doing poorly in 1st half of the class, don't assume you will do better in the 2nd half. It is possible that you will. It is likely that you won't. Past [student] performance is no indication of your success [or failure]. \n6) Conversely to #5, feeling you are doing great in the 1st half is no indication of how you will do in the 2nd half. Persevere. \n7) Try out the class. It is a good experience. But don't be afraid to drop the class if you are doing poorly. There is no shame in not completing this class or switching to a specialization that doesn't require it. ",

But you will learn a ton of math. Just be ready to work a lot. No other courses, no large commitments. Good luck!\n\nI spent 20+ hours every week of the semester on this class. 8 hours in an online study group, the rest by myself working the homework problems or the problem set. I learned a lot about LaTeX. \n\nThis is a math course. It's probably better off without the python. But you also probably don't know enough about writing in Math yet, so this is really difficult. From set theory and countability of infinite sets to graph theory and vertex covers and maximum matchings. There is a lot of math. The programs you will discuss are programs that will always output the reverse of the program given as an input, or a program that when run will output a program that when run that will output.... (etc. ) There is a lot of Logic. \n\nThe professor and TAs are working to make the course delivery better. Ideas have already paid off and they have more. They know it's tough and a lot to learn. The real problem, though, is that it's really two 3 credit courses given in the time of one. So this course is about as fun as drinking from a firehose. And I didn't even want to learn this much math. SOME math, sure. But this is a ton. \n\nAdvice: Work all the problem set problems. A few of them showed up exactly from the problem set on the test. Others illustrate how to push boundaries of the section's ideas. Also read Sipser. Generally avoid the udacity lectures, which seem rushed and not very instructive. ",

They presented the information in a pretty traditional, straightforward way (as opposed to the \"socratic\" approach of a class like ML), but they were sufficient. The quizzes embedded in the lectures were well-designed and more than just a trivial \"pick the right answer\". \n\nProjects - Favorite part of the class. Each project gave us a chance to use a tool in order to get hands-on experience with a topic covered in the lectures. Most of these tools required (or recommended) Linux in order to get consistent results. It would have been nice to start with a standard VM image, but it's also not difficult to set one up yourself. Regardless -- the projects were well-designed, relevant to the lectures, interesting, and most of all -- fun!\n\nExams - Both exams were open-notes. You could even use PDFs on your computer during the exam. Therefore, the questions on the exams required less rote memorization and more active application of the concepts learned. From what I've heard, most of the students that had trouble with the exams actually struggled more with ProctorTrack than anything else. That's unfortunate, but not really a knock on the exams themselves. The questions were fair and did a good job evaluating comprehension of the material. \n\nAdministration - The TAs and the professor were very active and helpful on Piazza. This is not necessarily always the case in other OMSCS classes, so it was definitely appreciated here. Most of the grading was done in a timely fashion, although a few of the assignments took longer than average. \n\nOverall - This class is an overview class -- you'll cover a lot of different topics, without going too far in-depth. The class is similar to CS 6035 in that regard. You'll get exposed to a lot of interesting ideas and use a variety of tools to explore those ideas, which hopefully encourage you to learn more in the future. I highly recommend this course. ",

A lot of the material has really stuck and I have been able to apply these principles to subsequent classes. \n\nI felt this class was more time consuming than hard. It takes a more hands-on approach rather than a theoretical one. There is a lot of time spent tinkering with data-sets and runing different algorithms. But, I never felt like I did not know how to do stuff or that the material was difficult to grasp, projects just took some time to iron out and decide how you wanted to procede with them. \n\nPersonally, I would have preferred a little more of a theoretical approach and deeper dive and increased focus on the underlying math, which was extremely light. But at the same time, this is a survey course that aims to cover a lot of topics, so perhaps it is not realistic to increase the depth too much without sacrificing breadth. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this course!",

Okay. Mission accomplished. But the grading criterion for this course seems to be:\n\n\"Grade the students on everything we threw at them, knowing they couldn't possibly absorb it all, then give them all a massive curve at the end. \"\n\nThe problem with this is that there's no guided prioritization of focus. I learned tons in this class. But because the average in the class right now is a 67 (averages for all assignments/exams except the final are available on Canvas) neither I nor the vast majority of the students in the class know whether the gained knowledge is what we were intended to learn in the course. \n\nOf the four course objectives the one I feel the course didn't help at all with was \"To develop the basic skills necessary to pursue research in ML\". There was no guidance at all in this area. We got assigned 4 analytic assignments without any guidance in what makes a good analysis in the target domain. We were given grades on our analysis assignments with little feedback at all. ",

The course covers many OS topics with focuses on design and implementation of concurrency system, i. e. , CPU, memory, IO and file systems. I would say the course is well prepared and taught, the lecture is organized, the teachers and TAs are engaged, and the piazza discussion is very active and fun (well, it could also be discouraging, when you see your classmates are way far ahead of you into the project works). \n\nI am not sure if the project assignment is my favorite part of the course, but it is definitely where I learn the most. I am not a programmer but as a PhD in electrical engineering, I do have quite some experience in programming (not C unfortunately). However, I did have a hard time with C. This is mostlikely the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background and skill sets of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve. Most of people's feedback is \"I thought I know how to program in C until I started CS8803 Intro OS\". \n\nThe content of the course is really straightforward, i would rate the difficulty for the course content 3. However, the programming assignments are substantially more difficult for those who are not experienced with C. I rate it 4. 2. Given the fact that project assignment takes about 3 times more time than the course content, the weighted difficulty is 3. 9. \n\nThank you Ada and also the TA s for the fantastic course. ",

Make sure you start early. Assignments are assessed by autograding using different data sets than the ones you have, so I kind of miss the Udacity autograder that I used to hate, since at least you know you get it when you get it.

The first two exams were essentially review for anyone who has done ER diagrams and relational modeling. The third and fourth exams were moderately difficult, with relational algebra/calculus and functional dependencies being the hardest concepts to master. Some of the exam questions regarding SQL were not everyday queries, so you did have to stop and think about what was being asked. Even though the exams were open book, not having lecture notes or some familiarity with the material would put you at a disadvantage. (Some students were \"kind\" enough to share their notes, and I'm surprised the instructors didn't put the kibosh on that. )\n\nConcurrent with learning about the theories, we had a group project assignment. As always, the most important factor is your fellow group members. I was lucky to have a hard-working team, which made me sad that there were no peer evaluations, as I would have gladly given them all positive feedback. (One problem with group formation is that there was a \"re-org\" deadline for groups to reform after a member dropped the course, that was before the final drop deadline. So some groups had less manpower if someone dropped after the \"re-org\". ) The timeframe for each phase of the project got progressively shorter and shorter, and so the effort level had to kick up a notch or two by the end of the semester. There was also a final WebEx presentation that didn't quite have all the kinks worked out, but was effective. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed this course and I found the later material very interesting and can say I learned something new. Dr. Mark, while no longer actively researching, clearly is an expert in the topic and has great opinions. The lead TA did a commendable job keeping things organized. It was a good experience. ",

The current professor is not very helpful and seems like since he isn't the one in the udacity videos, he wanted the udacity videos to play a small role in the course. \n\nThis class needs to be redesigned to not use proofs, then people would learn a lot more. You can learn the concepts of turing machines, graph theory, and NP without having to work out proofs. Teaching the overall concepts of the different algorithms would have been much more beneficial.

It's really hard but equally rewarding as long you can stay up to the end (I think only 36 of ~80 or so who started remained till the end). The labs are challenging & exams can be brutal (depending on where you stand under the overall distribution). \nProf. Vuduc & all the TA's are very good in what they do. They are almost always available on piazza, we had office hours almost every other week etc. Prof. Vuduc is not only good at HPC but has a very good sense of humor which he mixes well in between the lectures. That kind of lightens up the sometimes heavy content. Overall the video lectures are super excellent & worth while revisiting them when needed. \nIf you are willing to work hard & learn a lot, this is a course you shouldn't miss. I would highly recommend this course. ",

What is the point of practicing without something to align yourself against? Your work is being sent off into a void. Vague homework feedback that mostly consists of \"you did the problem wrong\"? Yea, thanks. One TA grading something correct, another TA grading the same exact thing incorrect. Homeworks that consist of 3 problems that most people spend 20+ hours on... followed by exams that consist of 6 problems with only 3 hours? Right... The final exam had you calculating inverse matrices involving 1/12th fractions by hand? What is the point of that? And every single homework and exam problem demanded that you produce a solution in some exact particular format or way, yet you rarely have any glimpse into what that format or way should look like. I learned WAY more while enrolled in 6505 from simply watching video lecture material and reading PDF note packages from other non-OMSCS courses. I learned next to nothing from 6505 directly, and the entire course was an exercise in futile frustration. For comparison, I took ML... ML was a tough class, but doable if you invest the time. 6505 is something else entirely. Avoid this course at all costs. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this course is so bad too, because the material under consideration is vital to a thorough understanding of CS theory. The material in this course is what separates CS from code monkeys. This is why you're better off not taking this course, and obtaining that knowledge through other sources. ",

I thought the first was pretty easy and the homeworks prepared you for it. The second I thought deviated quite a bit from the homeworks. Since it's closed book and you get just 2 hours, I was screwed on that one. I wish they made it clearer what topics will be on the test. Also, there were only two tests during the semester.

The last section of the course covers a few topics about distributed systems: file system; distributed memory; datacenter technologies, which are becoming more popular in the growing cloud computing field. In my opinion, it is a must-take course for students in CS background who need some refreshment for their undergrad OS class. OS knowledge is a core background requirement for almost all CS programs. \n\nFor the projects: there are 4 projects in total and 3 of them are coding projects. The projects are in C and some familiarity of C is required. I already have C background but the challenge is to complete the projects and pass the Udacity online grading. The online grading can be tricky sometimes because the online grader sometimes does not give you sufficient failure information, besides it is usually more rigorous than your local test run on VM. Many times, you need to insert fprint to just debug. That always takes a lot of time. The piazza forum is always very active and helpful. I would not be surprised if someone has to spend 40-50 hours on one particular coding project. The tip is to start early so you can spread the whole work into 2 or 3 weeks instead of trying to finish it during last weekend. My impression from Piazza is that people who do well in the projects tend to start very early and engage the discussion very early. \n\nFor the exams, it is closed book closed notes exam. You need to study the videos and read the materials. It is not very difficult, but you do need to spend some time studying them since there are a lot of concepts and details there. \n\nOverall, it is a very good class. It can be frustrating in the beginning, but if you stick to it and go through the whole semester, you will probably learn a lot. ",

Knowing some linear algebra is also helpful as 2 large sections of the course work with matrices. The assignments are mostly done in C, so make sure you're well versed with that. The level of C needed is (imho) about the same as that for AOS or similar courses. \n\nThe class is hard because achieving high performance is a difficult problem. If you do this class, you'll discover that even something simple like sorting which you may have mastered from undergrad now becomes an order of magnitude more complex and if you don't do it right you may have severely degraded performance even though you have N times more computing power. \n\nI highly recommend this class. Even if you're not solving a problem across many compute nodes, performance will always be important and this class will give you the right tools to write high performance software. ",

I found the exams to be more difficult than the assignments personally, mostly due to the format. Sadly, I didn't do as well on them as I would have liked and feel I could have done better on them. My recommendation is to take detailed notes as you watch the lectures and read the papers. Especially take notes as you read the papers. Some of the material is a little dense, and the lectures can be sometimes circuitous. If you're watching the lectures through the web, you can set the speed to 1. 25x for the youtube player. You might find this helpful if you're having difficulty focusing on the lectures. \n\nI had professional programming experience but only a little bit in C. I found the programming part difficult only as I was becoming acquainted with the problem. After that, the assignments are very straightforward. Projects 1 and 3 are time consuming and will take 20-30 hours of your time. Projects 2 and 4 will only take 3-5 unless you do the extra credit. \n\nJudging by my interactions with other students, if you're going to take this class and are not comfortable programming, you should:\n- Learn how to work inside a VM. Learn how to set up a shared folder between the VM and your host machine in advance if you think you'll need it (you probably don't)\n- Learn enough C. The C programming in this course is not hard, but if you're not comfortable with the language's semantics you'll be overwhelmed on the first assignment. \n- Learn how to work in GCC, GDB, Make and Valgrind. There are plenty of great tutorials out there. \n\nMy only complaint is that the sample exams in Udacity didn't adequately prepare me for the real exams. Other than that, this course is excellent. Professor Ada and the TAs were super responsive. I don't recall ever having to wait more than 20-30 minutes for a response ever. I definitely recommend taking this course. ",

            "text": "Quote: this course is a survey of algorithmic hacks to NP-hard problems. In reality, it was interesting to learn about present-state AI research from prof. Starner and his work in Sign Language recognition, wearable computing, and Dolphin communication. This course was the initial offering of 6601 for the OMSCS program. The professor and the TAs input an enormous amount of effort to pull off this course - my thanks to them. As a note of context, this course was advertised to be offered in Spring '16 and then cancelled late Fall '15 and then surprisingly re-released at the 11th hour. \n\nAs the course advertises in its description, it is intended for those who have some background in AI or are ready to jump into the deep end (true statement) The description asks for 9 hrs per week and it should be modified to reflect the true effort required in this class. Most students, including myself, input 20+ hours per week to stay afloat. Most of the time you spend will be on solving an assignment and researching. It's very easy to forget that you have to watch the lectures as well! \n\nThe professor's assignment methodology was to introduce a concept through lecture, then complete some 'warm-up' problems in the beginning of each assignment to develop intuition. At the end of the warm-up, you solve more difficult problems by implementing solutions that had not been explicitly covered in class. This was certainly the most rewarding and difficult part of the class!\n\nThere were several first-time hiccups in assignments and exams, however the TAs and the professor had open ears and minds and ultimately made it right and I'm sure that the next offering of this course will be even better. \n\nI learned an incredible amount about the material even though I felt overwhelmed during the majority of the course. This is certainly an opportunity to become familiar with the AI field with an intensive, hands-on experience from which you will benefit greatly. ",

Just for example - a major project of the class (The \"FHIR Activity\") was supposed to be a programming project. It ended up being 10 question, open-book quiz on t-square (that we could take as many times as possible and receive the highest grade), that was worth 15% of our grades. I took it 4 times in about 30 minutes with the reading material in front of me and got a 100% on it. \n\nI don't think even one assignment avoided having its due date changed. The course stuff repeatedly promised assignment materials by a certain date, and then consistently released them a week+ later and then changed the due date to compensate (and consequently acted like they were doing everybody a favor). \n\nThe lecture material was somewhat interesting, but there was literally only several hours of lectures total. \n\nThis class was an easy A at least. Don't bother with it unless that's what you're looking for or if you already have a great project idea that you want to explore with a group. ",

I ended up with a C, and I think it was just due toward the end of the class where I couldn't focus on it so much because I was spending all my time with my other life sucker of a class. \n\nThe material in this course is dense, rigorous, but it did seem regularized. The professor really wanted to clamp the students down to his style of learning. In a way, I enjoyed the \"isolation\" method that was suppose to bring about ones own ability to solve a problem. I think to some extent it worked. I felt like I was really using my brain, and I felt I was generally sharper in my daily life. These were the homework assignments. They were difficult, but we were given another chance to submit after they had been graded. I didn't do too bad on these, but honestly I spent too much time on them. I should have been focusing on the concepts as a whole which would have helped me on the tests which I never did too hot on. I spent forever on the HW assignment, and I never had time to do the challenge problems. I really had a time crunch, but like I said, I unknowingly set myself up for it by taking the big data class. \n\nThere could be something fundamental I was not getting, but over all, even if I liked it to some extent, this isolation method didn't seem like the best way to learn. I get it, that a degree in any establishment is given better credit when the students are not spoon fed answers. Yet, I felt like I did not have the proper tools to achieve an A. It's frustrating for sure, I don't know if I should take another semester and switch specializations or just try it again. I am a bit discouraged after it all. I did try to understand the material as I have done with my other classes. \n\nYeah, don't take this with any other high demanding course. Please don't. ",

You should really have experience working on a linux server so you can start using AWS and the hadoop environment. \n- Trying to differentiate equations that weren't ever mentioned in the course lectors or course prerequisites\n- making matrix multiplication work through Spark. \n- Easy Chair. it was anything but easy... or a chair. \n\nThings I didn't like \n- sometimes I felt TAs were very short. I can't entirely blame them, there is a lot on their plate. I wanted to turn in a newer version of my final project which I knew was still within the deadline.

Trying to do that would be like trying to learn Pre-Calculus and Calculus at the same time (as someone recently mentioned). \n\nThe instructor and TA seem very involved in improving the experience for all students. New for this semester: they returned a first submission of homework with feedback, and we had a resubmission opportunity for 100% of the grade (6 homework assignments - 3 problems each). Also new this semester: the course is now divided in three sections, for each one of them there's a proctored exam (closed book, one sheet of notes - two sided). So it was easier to study than for previous terms, when there were two exams. \n\nThe exam problems were very similar to the problem sets given for each unit. There were no \"official\" solutions for the ungraded problem sets, the philosophy of the instructor is that we should work on them on our own (but collaboration in study groups was encouraged - I know there were study groups on G+ Hangouts, Slack, and locally held meetings). Working on study groups really helped. An informal statistic for a group had: 11 A's, 10 B's, 6 C's. So that really makes a difference. \n\nIt was mentioned that there will be further enhancements to this course next term. Something else: do try to take advantage of every extra credit opportunity (if given). \n\nI definitely can say that I learned A LOT. There where weeks were I spent my weekdays after office 8pm-1am, and weekends all day long reading, working on homework, watching lectures from other universities.

However, there are things that should have been taken care of by a professor who has tough the subject before. To start with, we did not have a syllabus. The one provided by the teacher was a very high level organization of the course, which did not help much. We, students were the ones who put together a syllabus. The organization of the course was terrible as well. We had 4 exams. The first two covered easy material with plenty of time. The last two covered much more difficult material with less time to study it.

Once the exam period starts (and I'm not talking about the actual exam), we were not allowed to ask any questions regarding the subjects covered on the test, which I thought was an unfortunate and ill-advised rule. \n\nThe TAs were very helpful and questions were answered right away.

This class is tedious and time consuming, while 6505 is just plain difficult and time consuming. \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures did a good job of explaining the various machine learning algorithms. Most lectures described things relatively informally (no rigorous math or proofs). For some of the concepts, I kind of wish they had explained the math behind the algorithm a bit better, but for the most part they were very good\n\nHomework:\nThe homework is structured as four projects. There were two big issues with the homework. First, there was a sizable gulf between the material presented in the lectures and what you actually had to do for the projects. There was lots of outside reading required to understand how exactly to use the ML algorithms in an analysis setting. In other words, the lectures explained how the algorithms worked but you were on your own with the homeworks in terms of comparing them and determining which performed best and why. Second, you were kind of on your own when it came to picking tools to perform your analysis. As a beginner to these concepts, I spent lots of time evaluating machine learning frameworks to determine which best suited the assignment. This meant I was spending less time actually working with the algorithms and more time experimenting with machine learning libraries. The TAs and professor occasionally made suggestions, but it would have been nice to get a list of vetted frameworks for each project. \n\nAssembling the reports for the homework was tedious. It involves running multiple (hopefully repeatable), possibly long running experiments and usually plotting the right things for each algorithm. This was by no means _hard_, but it was time consuming. \n\nGrading/Administration\nI thought grading was generous. The homeworks were graded fairly, but it would have been nice to have a more explicit rubric. ",

There was not much help from the instructors and the Piazza forum was ran by only handful of students. The software analysis tool used was the one developed by the professor and it had limited documentation and no practical value unless you are into system programming, IDE development, Compiler design etc. \n\nSoftware Test part of this course is good and has some practical use.

It was kind of a competition: the teaching staff often posted the top 5 performers among the submitted projects, with metrics and whatnot, so I got to try my very bestest to make it to that list. It was madness! (good madness)\nEach project illustrated a very advanced element of HPC, so I left with a feeling of having learned a lot. \n\nProf. Vuduc has a very particular sense of humor, which he embedded in his videos. It surprised me how I never got fed up with the jokes. I guess I always find a true nerd's humor amusing. \n\nI'd like to invite everyone to give HPC a chance. The fact that it's not required for a specialization (anymore :'S) shouldn't mean it's not worth the effort. This class is the bomb! It's packed with algorithm design and analysis (and very clever algorithms, by the way), several models of computation that you may not have studied before, and probably should, oh and the projects are spectacular. If you like algorithms, programming, getting your mind blown, and are up for a challenge, this class is for you. It's hands-on Computer Science in my opinion. \n\nThere are some requirements that I'll try and emphasize here:\n - Running time and complexity analysis, Big O and Theta notation, the master method, etc. \n - C and C++. You gotta know how to code in these languages. I mean know them well. If you're afraid of pointers, you should get some practice first. \n - Basic Linux command line knowledge, as projects involve a virtual machine and the Deepthought Cluster. \n - Some linear algebra, as in virtually any other class. \n - C and C++. Yes, you need to be able to get an algorithm from a lecture or an academic paper down to functional C/C++ code. \n - Debugging in the woods with your teeth and a knife. \n\nGive it a shot, You'll have fun!",

Very interesting! \n\nNevertheless, I don't really agree with the course creator on the grading breakdown. The four exams accounted for too much of a percentage (15% each), while the final phase of the course project took us 20+hours per week but it accounted for merely 10%.

All of the harder parts in the second half are quite interesting whereas the beginning starts out a little slow and annoying with a lot of Python API introduction that could be done more efficiently (i. e. learn NumPy and Pandas API's on your own). \n\nThe class is worth taking for its own interest and also as an easy intro to Machine Learning. \nBe warned that the time requirements and any half-finished reports saying it is easy are very misleading. \nIt starts out super easy and lulls you into a false sense of ease which will be shattered one or two days after it is too late to drop the class. After the drop date you will suddenly find the time requirements go up by about a factor of 5. The hours per week workload in the beginning it is maybe 5 hours or even less but after the drop date it can easily jump to 20 hours per week or more if you are not a \"pythonista\" or try for bonus points. \n\nProfessor Balch is super engaged on Piazza which is awesome! One or two of the TA's are also fairly engaged but the rest generally don't help out on Piazza. \n\nMake sure you watch the schedule carefully. Make sure you pay careful attention to assignment requirements and always test on the GA Tech buffet machines or provided VM, especially for execution time restrictions. If you work hard, put in the required time, and ask lots of questions then the assignments aren't too hard and can be aced. However, messing up one assignment, especially from something silly like using a disallowed library or not making sure it works in the grading environment can cost you a lot, possibly even a letter grade for a big assignment. \n\nOne problem with the class when I took it was that the assignments were not finalized in advance, and sometimes not even until a couple days before the due date. Not only does this interfere with working ahead but having the requirements get changed after you already submitted is rather annoying. ",

At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program.

I have given 15 hours/week but I think you can do with 10 hours/week if you are very goal oriented and super focused unlike me. Whatever be your specialization, I think you should take this course to get the most professional OMSCS experience!!",

Highly recommended. \n\nWith only hobbyist-level experience in C, I could dive into the meat of the projects and found all of them challenging but fulfilling. Lectures kept my attention and sample exams proved useful in studying. Professor Gavrilovksa and TAs stayed very responsive in Piazza all semester. \n\nI would prepare for this course by establishing familiarity with (a) running VirtualBox VMs, (b) using source control in projects, (c) editing and understanding Makefiles, (d) debugging with valgrind or gdb, and (e) browsing system documentation such as manpages. \n\nOn Project 3 I got more pain than gain from Udacity autograder, but TAs allow you to tarball whatever you want and submit in lieu of Udacity. In my case they graded my tarball very fairly. ",

A lot of the projects used a \"unit test\" method through Udacity and the results of those tests gave you a pretty good understanding of what grade to expect.

I've taken a few other classes before and they all had a major disconnect between lectures and assignments -- the lectures were very thin compared to what was expected and a lot of self researching was needed. Dr. Bobick really does care about teaching this subject and wants you to understand and appreciate it fully and this shows easily in his lectures, which are formatted logically and are exhaustive (well, atleast for an intro course.. ). The TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, made good comments when assignments were returned. \n\nRegarding the content of the course, much of your time will be spent on parameter tuning rather than implementing concepts and algorithm (especially in problem set 2, the hardest one IMO). So it is a good idea to play with the parameters early in the course and get an understanding of how they change the results. It does get a bit math intensive towards the middle and latter part of the course so brushing up on your linear algebra would go a long way. The final was open-book and was quite easy and straightforward sticking to higher level questions than mundane specifics. \n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this class to bits and would easily recommend it to anyone looking to dive into this wonderful and nascent field!",

Basic knowledge of C. Received an A in the course. \n\nLectures are well done. However, the projects go over only several of the topics covered in lecture. Resist the temptation to save all of the lectures for later. \n\nProjects are done in C. Skeleton code is given, but a lot of thought needs to be put into how your implementation can play nice with the pre-written code. Also, a lot of time is spent wrangling with the autograder; sometimes the autograder doesn't provide any meaningful or consistent output. Projects are judged against several test cases; a difficult point for me was anticipating some of these test cases, but the project rubric and other people's questions and answers on Piazza gave helpful hints on what cases to anticipate. \n\nSpeaking of Piazza, questions are answered quickly, either by students, or the TA/the professor. Office hours are also consistent. \n\nNumber of hours spent: I had to work during lunches (every day during weeks when projects were due or an exam was being held), and an hour or two after work if I'm not already wiped out. Also had to devote several hours on weekends for projects and studying for exams. \n\nOverall, a very solid and straightforward class. There aren't any tricks or gotchas in my opinion, and results will accurately reflect the amount of work you put in. Be prepared to put in a lot of work though. ",

The Udacity lectures are simplistic and useless, although hilarious, since the presenter sounds like Elmer Fudd. The new Prof prioritized making this a weeder course. Valid solutions were not provided for prob sets, reason given was to have students work things out on their own. Side effect was that graded HW feedback could not be argued by students, as there was no ground truth to compare to. Much time was spent trying to \"prove\" things that had little to no practical real world value, (Cantor's diagonal argument). Difficulty defending any proof other than what TA's had in mind, or on answer sheet. Akin to religious argumentation. Prof mentioned struggling with 6505 himself when he took it recently. Seems this was payback time for the next batch of students. \n\nWarning, all online resources were banned. An ultimatum was issued halfway through the course for students to admit to having \"Googled\" to receive 0 on an assignment and have a note added to their permanent record to avoid more severe punishment. It seems several students had OSI investigations launched and received \"I\" incomplete or \"F\" on their transcripts. Imagine having this happen to you for looking something up on Wikipedia. \n\nUpdate: IRP stats are now up. http://www. irp. gatech. edu/reports/grades_by_instructorsmry. php. \nPryby - Spring2016 A:32, B:63, C:64, F:8, I:3, Total:170, (W:132) 44% failed\nBrubaker - Spring2015 A:38, B:15, C:9, D:11, U:1, Total:74, (W:107) 28% failed\nConsidering a C is not a passing grade for many specializations it is pretty severe that 44% of the non withdrawn students do not receive an acceptable grade.

When there were no projects released or assignments due, I would typically spend only a few hours a week. When a project was due, I would spend closer to 20 hours a week. I would recommend starting on projects when they are released, as if you do not, you will end up having to pull some late nights. The lectures were informative, but really did not cover what you needed to do on projects and assignments in great detail, though I think the professor's point that you cannot teach design through lectures is valid. \n\nThe one thing I really did not like about the course was the choice of technologies we had to work with. The projects involved implementing a tool called Gurobi, which is very poorly documented, and very hard to work with unless you understand what you are doing. For the first project especially, I spent at least 75% of my time trying to get Gurobi to work and 25% actually focusing on what the course teaches. ",

You don't need to have a project in mind before starting the class but since all the activities since week two are directed towards researching your problem space, you'll need to land on one pretty quickly. Alternatively, you can join someone else's project, which I'd probably recommend even if you have your own idea. With more people on the team, you can combine your efforts, build something more polished, and have more fun along the way. Otherwise, despite encouraging feedback from peer reviews, you might feel a little lonely in your one-man-project. \n\nDuring the first 5 weeks, there will be a short (~500 words) written submission documenting your research every week, followed by project proposal. In the next 8 weeks, you'll be working on the project, summarizing your progress in a short text or video recording every other week. In the final two weeks, you will combine all your previous notes and research to write an academic paper in a format and quality to be presented at a scientific conference. You don't have to officially submit it but even without doing so, you'll have gone through the entire process of researching a topic, identifiying a problem, designing a solution, and writing a paper about it. \n\nThe structure of the course is very free-form. There are no common videos or texts to read -- instead, you'll be expected to do your own research (i. e. find relevant papers, learn tools you want to use). There is a suggested breakdown of how much time you should spend on research/review/writing/programming in a given week (~10h/w total), but the actual content varies for each student. The plus side is, you'll be assigned a mentor who will guide you on your journey. And if you've known David Joyner for a while, you can be sure he'll post weekly plan and summary announcements, daily discussion threads, and reply to almost every comment. ",

I tried my best to be fair & hopefully it helps others. I got a B in this class. \n\nContent: Videos are highly analytic & professor often uses “so” & “therefore” to skip explaining a concept. I took this class under the impression that it’s related to the standard testing/QA but it was mostly about compiler design/efficiency. Video lectures quality is overall low especially towards the end. \nPre-requisites: Pre-reqs were removed from the course page later on. You need to be proficient in Java, C, discrete math …\nExams: I’ll summarize it with this epic story: Instructor posted a pdf with sample questions prior to the midterm & based on the comments on Piazza, majority of the class simply thought that he posted the wrong pdf or in the wrong class. Average for the midterm exam was in mid-50. Hopefully you can understand the gap here\nAssignments: They are written in a very dense academic format. Professor & the TAs weren’t helpful in explaining the assignment, providing resources or answering Piazza questions. They run a plagiarism program over all the assignments & you can end up at the dean office or get an F if they find you plagiarized. \nPiazza: Professor & TAs are very detached from Piazza but you see lots of helpful comment from the top 5% of the class. Anon post are not allowed. \nProfessor/TA: In a nutshell I think I’d have enjoyed this class a lot more if we had an active/engaged, professional & experienced professor. The staff was not open to any suggestion or feedback. I felt they were very much used to the on-campus traditional style of teaching & communication with students. Professor Mayur only showed up to say the harsh words or threaten students. Before finals week he sent a mass email saying: “I find that you plagiarized in this assignment while grading, the consequences will be severe: an F grade in this entire course. ”",

            "text": "This is my first class in OMSCS and this is a very good introductory class to OMSCS and Software Engineering. I’m working as Software Engineer but I still feel the class is fun and worth taking. It brushed up my git skills and introduced me to Android programming. \n\nThe instructor (Prof. Orso) is very active and always conducts office hours every week, he is also always present in piazza (except nearing the end of the semester, when he and all TAs were overwhelmed with grading and grade challenges). \n\nThe load is quite constant and I spent about 5-7 hours a week, except for the Android team project, which I spent almost 50 hours across 3 weeks span. But that’s more because I wanted to deliver a ‘nice looking UI’ with a close-to-non-existent Android expertise. \n\nThe contents are pretty straightforward and easy to grasp. There is no exam but instead your grade comes mostly from assignments and projects. Having said that if you want to get an A, you have to focus on the details of each assignment and project, making sure to deliver what the instructors expect from those assignments and projects (make sure to attend/play later the ‘optional’ office hours too, as often clarifications are given here - even though usually the piazza also has a corresponding thread). For some deliverables, the instructors may deduct quite some points for non-compliant items, so don’t underestimate the seems to be easy assignments and projects. The grades are also not curved (90+ to get an A) so it is important to get a good grade for every assignment/project. \n\nOverall, it is a great course, and I recommend taking it especially for new students as an introductory course to OMSCS and Software Engineering.

Some take an insane amount of time to complete, while others are very easy. The overall balance felt about right for the assignments. \n\nUdacity - Some lectures were better than others, but the quizzes in them were excellent. They really helped you learn the material. Very well thought out and the best quizzes out of any class I've taken. \n\nExams - horrendous. Absolutely did not test our knoweldge of the material whatsoever. Questions came out of complete left field and I feel are more ego-driven to show off how smart the professor is and his vast amount of knoweldge outside of Software testing than to actually test us on what we know. I failed the final and got a D on the midterm. But then again, the median grade for each was in the D/F range -- this alone speaks volumes. \n\nTime spent - This is hard to calculate, as some weeks were 40 hours, and then there were stretches of time where there was no work whatsoever. It fluctuates a lot, but I would say each assignment is 10-15 hours on average, and there were 8 assignments. \n\nA word of warning - this professor is absolutely obsessed with finding and punishing people who copy or reference code from other students or past classes. Multiple announcements were made throughout the semester, warning students of getting an F in the class and using heavy threats demanding \"they know who cheated, but if the student turns themselves in the punishment will be far less severe. \" The constant threats were irritating and seemed to really negatively affect student morale, especially the honest ones. This was very unprofessional and should have been handled discretely without obnoxiously threatening the entire class. \n\nAll in all. It was a solid class with a good amount of work. Grading was generous, even with the impossible exams. ",

Grading is curved and fair. Teacher and TA's are one of the best in the programs. The lectures could be improved to cover more materials required to complete the assignments as well as super important in any AI course (for example, Markov Chain); I have spent considerable amount of time learning concepts from outside source (online academic source, somewhat ironically) to complete assignments.

The course is not hard and you can make it fun but it is up to you. \nThe lectures are mere overview of the topics, my undergrad AI course gave me much deeper knowledge on AI. You're on your own discovering the topics; lots of readings are presented so you can dig deeper if you'd like. Which is nice. But I would go as far as don't even waste your time watching lectures if the title sounds familiar to you - for example there is a lecture on classification but it does not go into any mathematical or implementation detail whatsoever. If you've taken an AI, ML or CV class before (or you've read a few pages on wikipedia about statistical classification), you already know more than it is presented in the class. \nWritten assignment are fine, they are short and as the class doesn't, neither are you required to go into technical details. The grading of the papers is a bit of a lottery, depends a lot on the reviewer. I got points taken away for totally contradicting reasons between two assignments. \nThe coding homework is fun but barely has anything to do with the class materials. Turns out you better off implementing stuff on your own (hardcoding lots of stuff) and later claim that this for cycle is 'learning by recording cases' and those if conditionals are 'decision trees' or whatever. \nSo all in all interesting ideas are presented, coding can be fun (but time consuming if you're not good at Python), the papers are not hard and grading is generous but there is no connection between these. Requirements are not always clear and you never really know where you at performance-wise which caused frustration for some. You can easily get a B or A in this class with very small effort - papers can be done in an hour or two, you can skim through videos quickly and the 3 programming assignments can be done during a weekend. Rest of it is up to you. ",

I only went through two projects but the majority of my time spent was on set up and debugging the VMs provided. The second project literally wouldn't work as it was assigned, and required amendment via fellow students in T-Square to work. So that was a day+ lost. If something didn't work the recommendation was to rebuild the VM. Which even on my brand new MPB is a 20 minute process. \n\nI followed past my drop and apparently project 3 is even worse, with multiple amendments to non-functional aspects of the setup. I don't regret dropping it. \n\nEveryone involved is trying very hard but it's just not ready for prime time and doesn't really compare well to the rest of the OMSCS program. I want to spend the majority of my time learning, not fixing setup/instruction issues. I imagine that's true of most students in the program. ",

This has lead to the higher workload and sleepless nights from my part. I found taking AI and ML less stressful than dealing with the group projects in this course (comparatively when I took intro to health informatics, that group project was relatively pleasant)!\n\nAt the rate this course is going - it looks like it will be my first B of my 7 courses in the program.

            "text": "Reviewing near the end of the course. Great course that focuses on how classic CS concepts like graph theory can be practically applied by tailoring software for embedded systems. \n\nThis class isn't a hardware course, nor is it a course on how to write software for an embedded system. It's a class on how software is manipulated to run efficiently on power, hardware, and size limited devices. \n\nIt covers:\nembedded system instruction set architectures\nhardware support \ninstruction level parallelism\npipelining\nand compiler optimizations that take regular code and compile it such that it can run on embedded systems. \n\nThe course was condensed for summer but I think we still covered the same material. We had 4 homework assignments (initially 5), each taking about 5-15 hours to complete over 2 weeks. There was one project, taking about 20-25 hours to complete over a moth. There were also homework assignments due during this time. I think the full semester may have two projects, and two more homeworks that were smaller. \n\nThere was a proctored midterm and will be a proctored final, the midterm took an hour to complete (you get two hours). The level of difficulty was on par with the homework, but the test is closed notes. \n\nIn the condensed semester there were 2 lectures series and a reading per week for the first half, dropping to one of each after the midterm. The hardest thing to keep up with is covering the material in order to do the homeworks and take the tests, I recommend watching at 1. 25 speed due to reduce time spent. \n\nThe project and one homework were C++ programs. You can do this in your own environment, but you will run some code on GT's deepthought cluster via SSH. There's no GUI, but all you need are basic Linux commands. The assignments were straightforward implementations of concepts from the lectures/readings. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this course. If you are taking CCA, this course will apply some of the Graph theory concepts covered there. ",

However, the programming projects were a bit more difficult and extremely time consuming, thus the reason for my higher average workload feedback. Mark Moss was a very good professor. He attended all office hours together with the TA's. TA's were also very responsive on Piazza as well, so support was easy to get if you asked for it. Projects were all java based which was nice because my Java background is lacking, so I was able to learn a new programming language as a result. In terms of project details, the first project was not team based and required decent knowledge of optimization concepts and the use of the Gurobi optimization framework. So you would be wise to brush up on Linear Programming optimization. Projects 2 & 3 were team based and as someone else mentioned on a different review, if you have a strong team, you will love this course! We had a diverse set of skills that allowed us to get very good grades on the projects, in addition to coming up with really cool designs and implementations. For our last project, we pretty much designed a full web based distributed application that utilized Vaadin (web gui), Spring (MVC framework), and the Gurobi optimizer. These are all technologies that I believe are used in the real world so I believe I can really apply what I have learned. ",

Most of the assignments are related to compiler optimization and scheduling. The video course material is riddled with errors and inconsistencies, explanations of topics are pretty weak and assignments come in verbose long paragraphs of text walls which also have some errors in them. So to do any assignments the best thing is to wait it out on Piazza and have all the questions answered before you begin to solve one. The best way i found to go about this course is to ONLY read the text book and do one of the many other compiler lectures (from CMU online) to understand the text. They should really throw away all the material they have created and make a new one. Honestly, this is one course you can absolutely do without (or you can audit in your spare time if you wish) not because of the course content but the haphazard way of delivering content mired with errors. \n\nThe grading is lenient so at least that is a positive and once you cut through the clutter, the course material is moderate difficulty.

Other diagrams get supporting roles. \n\n2) the taxonomy of architectural patterns that arose as software systems and their teams became larger over the history of the industry\n\nIt delivers on those two fairly well. However the standout feature of the course, to me, was ILP (integer linear programming) with the commercial-grade solver Gurobi. I knew nothing about ILP and now I can't get enough. I have an extensive Java background, so learning \"ILP in Java\" meant one new thing paired with one old thing. NC State University hosts a large library of Gurobi code samples in multiple languages. Find them!\n\nEvery silver cloud must have a dark lining, so caveats from my view:\n\n1) grades focus on the _syntax_ of your diagrams, not the quality of the architecture expressed. I got all points on syntax-perfect diagrams of ideas I considered underwhelming. \n\n2) in summer, grading took forever. I didn't get any informative grades until two days before the drop-with-W date. You cover half the courses' content before you get grades on the first real assignments. \n\n3) also in summer, course staff did not assign any OCL homework, despite several hours of lectures and a reading on OCL in the syllabus. a one hour overview would suffice, without using OCL for any assignments where we can practice and receive feedback. \n\n4) another summer specific comment: some assignment windows overlapped, including the final project.

They ranged from straightforward to tedious due to the wide range of skills needed. For example, the first assignment favored those who had a C-background while the last assignment favored those who were savvy with JavaScript. I would recommend doing a 'bonus' project, preferably one which is geared towards your own skill set. \n\nLectures were split between Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee. Those given by Ahamad will literally put you to sleep. Lee keep a more brisk pace. I am not big into reading text books at all, but willed myself into reading this time due to many of the quiz (and therefore midterm and final) questions being pull from there. The quizzes are open book/notes and answers can easily be found online, but it is recommended to first attempt them without assistance since the midterm and final are closed book/notes. \n\nThe main reason that I took and would recommend this class is if you are going for the Computing Systems concentration.

As others pointed out, there is a large breadth of topics covered (and a corresponding lack of depth), which similarly has pros and cons. \n\nThe good: A lot of the topics are quite interesting, and if you are not a security person already, you will probably leave this class more aware of some area(s) of security that can help you in your career. The technical meat of some of the projects can be both interesting, challenging, and fun. They make it easy to get an A if you put in the effort. \n\nThe bad: Sometimes, getting started on the projects is hard for the wrong reasons (environment setup, somewhat lacking documentation for specific things, etc). It is nothing that one can't get past, but if you have limited cycles, those problems can at times be frustrating. The really unfortunate result of that was that it was the crack in the foundation of the class opened up the floodgates of incessant whining on Piazza. I understand a bit of grumbling about the project setup problems, but people started complaining about every little thing, when the reality was that most people probably did fine in the class. I truly believe that if we hadn't had those project problems, people would not have complained so much about other things. Sorry fellow students, but please make sure you are making a constructive comment before you reach for that \"anonymous\" button!\n\nThe ugly: As with any security class, you will leave realizing how insecure everything is. Good luck sleeping!\n\nSecret key to success: Buckle down and do the readings (don't just skim!). It will makes the quizzes and exams easier, and there is sometimes a deeper dive of content, or even non-overlapping content in the texts. You will get more out of the class. \n\nFinal note: To the anyone that suggests Googling for quiz answers: are you sure you want to be in the program? If you just want a piece of paper, I there are some other lovely online degrees you can pursue. ",

The learning curve is very strange, the 1st project(Runaway Robot) had some hard moments, but then final project really through me(and many others) for a loop. The lectures felt very... shallow and I do not think they adequately prepared me for either of the last projects. \n\nI would have much rather had more time spent on some of the concepts, better lectures, and better Udacity quizzes. \n\nThis class really feels like it needs a face lift. \n\nOverall, I would say this class(as it stands right now) could probably be paired with another easy/medium class.

I do think the ratings on this class at the time I took it are very deceiving. Perhaps others didn't need the time I took but the projects both required quite a bit of time. I am an accomplished programmer, and that helped, but I should've taken a linear algebra refresher before this class. Also, I would suggest those who do not program or have very little coding experience NOT take this class until you've had some experience coding or at least really understand the math (linear algebra and trig) that is necessary. While the sheer number of lines of code necessary isn't huge, the application of the concepts require some experience with programming languages (preferably Python but you can pick Python up if you know Java or C). Also, reading other comments here, they've made some changes to the course. Submission of Project 1 is no longer via Udacity. The Udacity grader is still in place and you can use it for testing, but your submission is via tSquare. Finally, I agree the videos could've contained a little more in depth content, as the concepts needed for the projects are not covered in great detail in lecture. Outside research is required if you are not already familiar with the information. This can take more time than counted on but does lead to learning. ",

The lectures were very high level, and the assignments required us to write about vague AI based solutions to known problems without getting into any implementation. The project was fun and challenging, but I didn't need any of the knowledge I learnt from the course. \n\nOverall, take the course if you'll be satisfied with a very basic introduction to AI, or if you want an easy A.

The mathematics are not very advanced or sophisticated (trig, probability, and some calc), but they can be a stumbling block in the projects. This is a good summer class, or something to pair with a crazy hard class -- there isn't really enough material in the course to fill a full semester. \n\nThe problem sets from lecture are very simplistic. It typically required more time to figure out how to perform the required actions using their custom implementation of a matrix class (with a very un-pythonic API) than to actually solve the problems. It is possible to frontload all of the lecture material, but you can't get too far ahead because the project details were not released until much later. \n\nIt seems like the staff is well aware of the issues, because the bulk of the final grade (~75%) comes from one individual project and a group final project, and they encouraged \"optional\" pseudo-extra-credit assignments to research and/or implement many of the more advance concepts (beyond the scope of lectures). The individual project is available on Udacity, but don't work too far ahead until they release all of the details. The group project is... a group project (yuck!) with scores determined (in part) through competition with the other teams (ugh). In both projects, it isn't clear what the learning objectives are, since the techniques taught in the class typically produce very poor results without extensive additional effort, while other techniques often perform surprisingly well with very little effort. \n\nThe class seems designed to run on autopilot for the staff, and peer learning is limited because the material does not lend itself well to group discussion -- especially on the final project where discussion with other teams may cost you a competitive advantage.

This course addressing the topic of artificial intelligence from a methodological standpoint rather than discussing the algorithms and frameworks for implementations. It is important to set your expectation straight before jumping into this course. David Joyner is an exceptionally good teacher. GATech is lucky to have him. \n\nThough solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices in course project is fun, I have to say this course is pedagogically flawed. First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words? The most funny part is the TA's feedback, which goes like: How well does the assignment describe the problem it is attempting to solve?: 5 …. Though I got really good grades, I am very sure that I learned nothing from the assignments. I was really close to quit this course after reading the TA's feedback to my first assignment. ",

However, I did have a hard time with picking up C. I believe, this is the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (trust me, I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher myself in a European university before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve.

Execute a buffer overflow attack - make sure you're up on your C programming and have an intimate knowledge of how the OS lays programs out in memory. \n2. Malware analysis - we used a virtual machine to safely study malware. This project is basically following the instructions with no independent thought. \n3. Cryptography - implement cipher block chaining, and search a keyspace to try to crack ciphertext. Your choice of Python or Java for the assignment. \n4. Web security - launch a XSS, XSRF, and SQL injection attack against pre-supplied PHP code. \n\nAs you can see, these projects target different skillsets. You may have an easy time with one over the other. \n\nThe exams: There is very little required in the way of synthesis with the material, but there is a LOT of material to learn.

It left me wishing that there was a more advanced offering for RL in this program. \n\nThe work portion of this course consisted of eight assignments and two projects (for the summer semester; there are three in the normal offering, I think). The assignments were kind of hit-or-miss. There were a few that were excellent and engaging, and there were a few that were a bit too easy or disconnected from the material. Additionally, there were a few problems with the autograder site, either in terms of what it would accept or where there was a marked disconnect between what the assignment description on the site said versus what was actually expected. Just be sure to check the descriptions on Piazza and attempt submission early. \n\nThe projects were reproductions of academic papers accompanied by a short written report and a brief video. The projects were interesting, but not as open-ended or as tough as ML. Make sure that you have some ability to create a video (e. g. slides and voice-over) and don't leave it for the last day. ",

You'll learn the basics of how to do things like buffer overflows, malware analysis, encryption (cracking), and exploiting vulnerable websites. \n\n2)Some of the TAs were particularly good to work with. I'm looking at you Matt and Peter. \n\n3) Some of the projects were really fun. Project #1 (overflows) and Project #4 (web vulnerabilities). \n\n4) You get the opportunity for extra credit via an optional project that expands on one of the \"official\" projects. \n\nNow unfortunately the things I didn't like:\n\n1) I can't say this strongly enough, \"logistics\". I get this is a summer course so everything is condensed, but there were problems across the board regarding issues with projects and issues with autograders. The \"optional\" project grading policy was changed no less than 3 times within a week of the end of the semester. \n\n2) Get ready for some quizzes with \"subjective\" or \"ambiguous\" true/false questions. Good luck arguing them. They'll say not to read into them too much; but then come back at your challenge with some convoluted worded reasoning why you're wrong. \n\n3) The book is absolutely tedious to read. The authors need to understand the concept of \"run on\" sentences. \n\n4) Grades on practically EVERYTHING were held up because someone was suspected of cheating. \n\n5) Some of the projects seemed like straight busy work (cough Project #2). \n\n6) Some of the projects seemed like they added extraneous stuff just to make our life harder (cough Project #3). \n\n7) They'll crackdown on cheating, but let students ask questions on Piazza that practically go through step by step what to do. Seriously. Wait till a day or two before the projects are due and just read through Piazza and you won't need to do any work. This has got to be the biggest \"nope\" for me. I think it demeans the value of the program when people no longer have to try or even research on their own. ",

I think the course was a lot harder than some of these reviews suggest. \n\nThere were two types of challenges for extra credit: research challenges and hardware challenges. I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project. \n\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A). \n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda! \n\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don't regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work. \n\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution. ",

            "text": "Overall, a good course. Provides a decent overview of computer security concepts, but doesn't dive into most of them very deeply. \n\nLectures:\nSome of the lectures are quite long. Most of them repeated or rephrased what was in the book. Not the best lectures I've had so far, but not terrible either. \n\nHomework:\nThere's a quiz portion to your grade. The quizzes are open everything and were taken verbatim from phrases in the textbook. To make the best use of them, it's best to read, watch lectures, and then attempt the quiz with everything put away. Afterwards, you can check your answers and submit. \n\nThe projects in this class were probably the best part. There are four projects that each focus on some aspect of computer security. Most required writing some code, while one consisted of analyzing malware. Each one took me 4 to 5 hours to complete, so not terribly hard. The project that dealt with finding vulnerabilities in a web application was the most fun. There were also some optional projects which could be used to bump up a low test or project grade. \n\nTests\nTests were multiple choice and proctored. They didn't take too long to complete, and if you actually were doing the reading, they were fairly straightforward. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThe TAs were fairly active on Piazza. Grading seemed fair to me, with most projects auto graded. There were a few projects that had hiccups, but the TAs seemed to fix them within a few days. \n\nAdditionally, it was nice that the class offered optional projects. \n\nBook:\nThe textbook for this class was interesting at its best, and extremely dry at its worst. You _might_ be able to get by without the textbook here, but it was extremely useful in studying for tests and quizzes. \n\nConclusion:\nWorth taking if you're looking for a summer class and don't have broad knowledge of information security concepts.

There are weekly assigned lectures and readings (papers provided by the instructor). \n\nOn Summer, an assignment was due every week, I'd say their goal was assessing that the students understood concepts explained on the lectures. You do not submit code, only results, so you could solve them with Java, Python, Excel, pencil and paper. There's an auto grader available! Some assignments were more interesting than others. \n\nIn Summer we only had one final exam (25 true/false questions, and you had to explain your answer). It was hard to cram all that information in one week (assuming you started to study once you submitted the final project). It seems that in full semesters, a midterm was also part of the evaluation, that would have made the load more manageable. \n\nFor both projects assigned (midterm and final project) we had to replicate the results of published RL papers. We had to explain about our implementation, the assumptions we made, the difficulties we had, etc. You can use any language/library since code was not submitted, only the report and a 3-minute video presentation. You learn a LOT doing that. Start working as soon as you can in the projects! \n\nAt the end, the grading was generous, since people who were on the C (70-80%) or B (80-90%) brackets, ended up earning the upper grade (B, A, respectively)\n\nI highly recommend this course if you are interested on the topic. You can go as deep as you want in the material. The resources shared by the instructor are gold, and will give you many ideas for future work or research. ",

The lectures are informative and thought-provoking, but there's not a whole lot of depth. Perhaps the suggested readings were intended to supply the depth, but I didn't find them necessary for success in the course.

Gavrilovska is a published OS researcher, so knows the material intimately. TAs were incredibly helpful on Piazza with quick replies and knowledgeable (Tony Mason completely rocked it). \n\nThe only complaint I would have is that the Udacity autograder was configured to execute code that was different from what we were provided to test in local VMs, so several times I found myself ripping my hair out trying to figure out why some client-server test was timing out on Udacity after 10s but completing in milliseconds on my local VM. It seems the TAs love to set up network partition errors for client-server tests. You know who you are... ;)\n\nOverall great course, got more in-depth OS knowledge than I came into it with, and feel like it was one of the best-organized courses I've taken so far (3rd in the program).

The project is an app to support transaction processing and report generation, with the first phases consisting of logical modeling, turning in a few diagrams and reports, involving maybe a few hours of work on each person's part. \n\nThen you implement it. It's not a huge chore, but you have to build the database, find a place to host it, connect it to a server with the business logic, with a working ui on the front end that supports all of the required forms. To prove it works, you populate it with a dummy history. Simple enough, but right at the last minute, they threw up samples that had to be in with specific dates that were months in the past. If you implemented a correct database, one of the constraints is transactions can't take place in the past, so at the last minute you go in, remove the constraints, throw in the transactions, fix the schema and hope you didn't break anything so the gotchas in your demo don't return bad query results. \n\nThe kicker is the final is a few days later, covering material that bears no relation to anything else we did (indexing and physical file organization), from lectures that weren't available on Udacity until a few weeks prior when we were right in the heat of the project. That project, which takes up more time than the rest of the course combined, is worth 10% of the grade, and the exams are all multiple choice with 0 partial credit, so you get the final asking you exactly how many bytes are required to implement a specific kind of dense index and if you're off by 20, 0 points. 25 questions, so 3 wrong and you no longer have an A. There's no curve, so you can see for yourself that somehow one of the easiest courses in the program ends up with one of the lowest grade distributions.

You start with very small toy problems that can be solved directly using dynamic programming. From there, you gradually introduce the complications of the real world - infinite state spaces, stochastic reward functions, the inclusion of other agents that may be cooperative, adversarial, or indifferent, all the while learning of research from the past few decades resulting in tractable ways to induce human-or-better levels of performance in domains such as game play, autonomous drone flight, logistics scheduling, teaching robots to walk. \n\nThe idea is absurdly simple. Start with effectively random prediction of how well particular primitive actions might work and successively refine those predictions from whatever feedback you eventually receive, which may or may not be accurate feedback. Somehow this works, and this course gives you a mix of the mathematics to prove when and why it works, why it might work in practice even if you can't prove it works, and some of the practical research leading to hacks and tricks that make it work faster, better, or both. \n\nThe pros are the lectures and readings are engaging, insightful, among the best you'll get in this program. The projects, reproducing published research, give you the valuable real-world experience of just hacking away and making educated guesses until success magically happens. Then you have to figure out how it happened and be able to explain it. \n\nThe con is the weekly homeworks are too easy, simple algebra problems that might take a few lines of code but sometimes you can just do in your head, none of which take more than a couple minutes, basically free points. That time could be devoted to more projects. Function approximation (deep RL) especially is critical and hot and in the headlines and we barely covered it. ",

On the one hand it may expand your mind and you'll see connections and duality of many classes of problems, you'll spend time trying to fathom infinities that are greater than other infinities and create programs that consume themselves and result in contradictions. On the other hand you may experience extreme anxiety, delusions, dissociation, lack of sleep, and paranoia. You may have a bad trip. \n\nThat said this class is not really the monster it is made out to be. Complaints about it being too mathy or taught by a math professor are misguided. It is very mathy and you should accept that for a theoretical computer science course. For a graduate program you should also be prepared to write proofs and reason mathematically about the algorithms. \n\nTo stretch the analogy, going into CCA high on anxiety and fear will not help you out. Be prepared but not afraid. To prepare: watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation series on YouTube while you read along with your copy of Sipser for the Computability part of the course. Watch the first 3 lectures from MIT OCW Math for Computer Science to warm you up on proofs. Start going through chapters of CLRS that match the complexity and algorithms part of the course. In particular pay attention to graph algorithms, dynamic programming and linear programming as they are a big part of the final algorithms section. Practice all the reductions you can for the complexity section. The format may change semester to semester, but here's a hint: if they give you practice problems - practice them - all of them - because the practice problems may show up on the exams. ;)\n\nLastly, don't delay the course. Maybe not make it your 1st course, but making it the last is not advised since that will just add to the stress of taking it. The best way to prepare for CCA is to take CCA. Good luck. ",

Firstly while I ranked the class Easy because it is pretty easy to do the base requirements of the class, I actually spent the same number of hours per week on this course in the summer terms as I have spent per week on ML and CCA during the full terms. This is partly a factor of the reduced term period, but also because I also spent a lot of extra hours on Above & Beyond work for the homeworks just because I got obsessed and was having fun. If you restrain your enthusiasm then you will reduce your workload by a large amount. On the other hand I think putting in the extra time will help you get more out of it because the base parts of all the homework assignments are pretty easy and simple. \n\nWhile the material and base assignments were pretty simple, this summer the assignments were being reworked for autograding which meant they were not released in advance, so it made dealing with summer travel more difficult as we had about 2 assignments due each week for the first two months of the course. The pace was sustainable but a little tiring due to my travel plans and not being able to work ahead. Be aware of that even though the course is ranked easy (in future semester perhaps this won't be a problem). \n\nI had taken CV prior to this course, so in several areas the CP material was simpler and a less in-depth treatment of the material. However in the 6th and 7th lecture modules of the course they cover more specialized topics that were interesting and for the \"8th\" module we were given a collection of 6 academic papers to read. Reading those were my favorite section of the course and I highly recommend reading them early as they give some good ideas for final projects. Like the above & beyond work, you will get more from the class if you challenge yourself on the final project - that gives you a chance to go deep into an interesting area of your choice.

I will admit that I have no prior experience in robotics and I felt that I will learn the concept along the way. The lectures were frustrating , skim in details and glossed over necessary mathematics to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. I spent many hours over them but was still not able to understand the maths. The TAs though active did not do anything to help you understand these concepts. The office hours with Dr Thrun were of no help either. \n I just felt that they are deliberately trying to hand over B’s and C’s to students. You can confirm that from grade distribution for Spring 2016 where only 48% people got an A as opposed to 80% in earlier semesters. I have no problem with getting a lower grade as long as the subject simulates my thinking and helps me understand the concept. I wasn’t able to grasp any concept taught in the class , as the projects did not require any application of the concepts. This course might have been tolerable in the past when 80 - 90% people got an A when the instructors understand that the material provided in this course is too superficial and graded accordingly. But instead of improving the quality of the course , they decided to add vigor by making testing harness hard and by ensuring that 50% people should get B or lower. If you miss one single test case , you will lose 10 - 12 points and then there is no coming back. (Hint : Please confirm for runway robot1 , which values can be negative. It will be obscurely defined and if you miss it you will be done. ) \n If you get lower marks in project 1 , promptly withdraw from this course. (No please don’t fall for we will consider hardware and software challenges if you are in between grades. There were 5 software challenges and 4 hardware challenges and if you do them all , they will account for 1 mark. ). Stay away or learn all maths before hand. ",

The lectures were fun, although Professor Thrun's relentless encouragement seemed sarcastic at times. I certainly agree with other reviewers when they said certain concepts were only mentioned in passing before having to implement them in the next section, but since you could always look at the answer, it didn't seem like as much of a road block. \n\nThe rest of the class seemed like a disaster. Thrun's lack of interaction with the class, although understandable, was certainly a bummer. The TAs seemed like they were planning on dropping there interaction level from the start. Strict adherence to policy with little to no personal responsibility for actually nurturing understanding. They dangled an extra-credit-carrot for piazza posts, which is just stupid at a fundamental level. You have a torrent of answers from C students instead of just the normal overachievers; it made piazza pretty much unusable. \n\nThe pacing of the course is also completely out-of-whack. In the beginning it seems like you can just do a lecture a week and you will be fine, as they take only an hour or so. By the final lecture you are having to do additional research and re-watch videos in order to understand the concepts and they end up taking much longer. By the time the projects start (if you don't front-load) you feel like you are constantly playing catch-up. This only adds to the stress you feel because the projects don't really line up with any of the lectures. ",

No code submission for the projects... just a report and video presentation. Some of my grades on the projects and exam were definitely not that great, but overall grading was fair given the class changes and compressed summer schedule.

Sometimes it takes a while to get what each project is about, but once you get a hang of it, the project can be done in a reasonable amount of time. (I spent about 7 - 10 hours per project) Furthermore the classmates are very helpful with the projects, even to the extent of almost giving away some of the answers. Most of the projects are auto-graded, so the answers are only either correct or wrong and no room for subjectivity. There were some hiccups with the auto-grading but the TAs quickly rectified them. \n\nExams: Similar level of difficulty with quizzes, not that challenging but good understanding of the concepts is needed to provide correct answers. \n\nOptional projects: Intended to be a grade boost, but it seems everybody did quite well so that the final grade curve was also boosted. Students are allowed to submit multiple optional projects but only one will go into the final grade. \n\nOverall it is a fun class, worth taking if you have little or no background in computer security.

The assignments have been retooled somewhat to include more complexity, providing more of a challenge. In addition, at least for this summer term, we were presented with the full workload from an academic term in the compressed summer timeframe, meaning most of the 11 assignments were given two at a time (and not in advance. ) In some cases, changes were still being made to assignments days before they were due. \n\nThe course material itself is fascinating; I really enjoyed everything we learned about, and in retrospect would have preferred taking this course in a full term to really be able to dig into the material, instead of just finishing up assignment after assignment. The final project was especially rewarding. The exam was \"check all that apply\" multiple choice, appeared deliberately vague and misleading in places, and was a mess in my opinion. \n\nAdministration of the class this summer was also troubling. The professor was entirely absent - he weighed in twice in Piazza and was otherwise absent, and his TAs appeared to have trouble getting guidance on simple questions that needed to be answered for assignments that had been changed (e. g. \"Can we use X function, or is it in the group that is not allowed?\"), leading to confusion and frustration on the part of students. The confusion, stupid fast workload and angst all made what should have been an enjoyable survey course one of my least favorite in the program as far as organizational issues went. That said, I greatly value everything I learned in that class, and will take a risk on taking CV with the same instructor -- during a regular term! -- solely because of what I learned there.",

He never showed up once and coming from a class last semester where the professor was heavily involved this was a let down. The videos were also weak in a number of areas where complicated concepts were glossed over and never really explained in great detail leaving the TAs to have to try and explain these concepts. The class also seemed to have copied in large part the material from a Stanford course CS295. Some of the assignments for example were taken word for word from the Stanford assignments. Luckily some of the videos from Stanford explain the material way better. I find this really disgusting considering we are always asked not to plagiarize. \n\nOverall the material was not what I was expecting. A number of assignments used libraries with little or no documentation that was often times inaccurate or was utilizing libraries on projects that had been abandoned years before. I really think this class could be better described as to what it is covering and better if some of the more useless aspects were removed.

A lot of times in the quizzes, Dr. Thrun says, \"It's ok if you can't figure this out, just view the answer, \" which means you can coast through the Udacity lessons. What he really needs to say is, \"If you don't understand the math for this, run away, far, far, away. \" Because, when it comes time for the projects, you will need to implement some of these algebra or calculus functions on your own. My math skills are weak (and I'm working on bringing them up with outside coursework because math is the foundation for all that we do) and my mathematical programming skills (especially for Python) weaker. \n\nI understand that from my personal perspective, I was not \"ready\" for this course. And the shortened schedule of summer semester means if you aren't ready, you are either expecting a moment of genius, or are going to drop the course. You can guess which one I chose. Others with a deeper background and familiarity with the basic concepts presented in the course, and an understanding of the logical processes required, will do just fine. If you are one of those people, fantastic! I hope to be at your level someday soon.",

It's also helpful if you already have experience writing \"vectorized code\" (like in Matlab, Python with Numpy/Pandas, etc). \n\nSyllabus:\n\n- R programming (most of the course will be in R)\n- data visualization\n- data processing\n- logistic regression\n- linear regression\n- high dimensions and regularization\n \nEach one of those \"chapters\" is covered in two weeks, so typically in that lapse of time you watch the lectures and work on the homework/project associated with that chapter. \n\nGrading: \nThe course features three assignments, an individual project (divided in a midterm project, and final project), and a final (open book, not multiple choice) exam with the grade distributed equally between these components (33% all hw, 33% project, 33% exam). \"",

It took me 30-40 hours (sometimes as many as 50) hours per week for the rest of the semester to pull my grade up to a B by the end. In the end, I actually had a C but on the final I had answered a question correctly, but not the way he wanted me to and eventually he allowed that I had not only answered it correctly but has proved my answer and so he gave me full credit (I couldn't argue for partial credit) for the question and I got to a B. \n\nThe lectures need to be redone and I think they really need to think about how they have structured the course.",

Really when you think about it, the fact that so many professors at this school are self ingratiated is actually part of the reason why classes like this, that are so poor and devolved from reality, exist in the first place",

The good thing is that unlike some other courses, you can choose your team members. The exam is straightforward as long as you watched the lectures, or did the assignments. The second project was pretty nice, since it allowed you to develop a whole system, and allowed the students to work with many different components and languages, which I found useful. The biggest annoyance with the projects is that they require you to interact with a Gurobi which is very poorly documented and hard to use. I spent more time in this course learning that Gurobi than I did doing anything else. That being said, you can pass this course or get an A, as long as you put in the time and the work.",

Coming from a SAS-heavy background with no knowledge of R, I've appreciated the opportunity to get my hands into data manipulation and visualization using R. We also had the opportunity to learn the mechanics behind linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization. \n\nThere are 4 homeworks (technically 3, but the 3rd counts as double and is twice as long), all of which have been doable in a reasonable amount of time. The project this semester is divided into two parts, and is about analyzing and visualizing movie characteristics from IMDB's database to find the best predictors for gross revenue. I thought it was pretty neat to be given a real world problem with imperfect data to analyze. Don't procrastinate on the project. Unless you're really handy with R, it'll probably take 30-50 hours for each part (divided into two parts, due at different times). \n\nI really enjoy watching the lectures (sped up to 1. 5x), and the professor provides the lecture slides so you can actually just sit, comprehend, and follow the notes rather than screenshotting the video every two minutes. The professor is very active on Piazza, which makes up for the extreme lack of TA participation.",

I'd say it is an intro to the broad field of HCI. There is no prerequisite for CS 6750, and you'll be perfectly fine with a different background. \n\nThe workload is very light at 15 h/w, more or less. There is one written assignment each week, which consists of four questions, and each should be answered with up to 300 words. Answering the questions requires watching weekly lectures, and reflecting on their objectives. These assignments are publicly available at: http://omscs6750. gatech. edu/fall-2016/full-course-calendar/\n\nCS6750 is very different from code-intensive courses that have coding assignment (e. g. CS 6300 SDP). In HCI, you will describe and analyze user interfaces. I think everyone that designs computerized products should take this course. It gives you a different perspective to look at your tasks, and the interface you use to achieve your goals. \n\nThe Video Lectures are not publicly available, but you can view the Scripts at: https://drive. google. com/drive/folders/0B1-VjNQe61hsYi1YanNYYzdkd3c\n\nIn addition to weekly assignments, there are two exams that should be taken via Proctortrack. These exams are open-note; which means you may watch the lectures as you answer the exams, or review your notes. \n\nFacts:\nNo required textbook or readings. \nNo coding assignments. \nGrades are not curved ( B >= 80, A >= 90 ). \nInstructor is very active in Piazza. \n\nHCI should be perfect for Summer.

The entire assignment can probably be done in a single (multi-hour) session. It was quite easy and somewhat interesting. \n\nThe third assignment involves writing IPS/IDS rules using snort to classify network traffic as malicious or benign. This asignment was the most difficult for me and it seemed to cause issues for others as well. Writing snort rules was not particularly hard, but the way the assignment was presented was pretty vague. After prodding the TA we were given some, but not enough in my opinion, additional information. In particular, we were asked to write rules \"with a long shelf life\". There was some comedy here when some of the \"benign\" traffic that was sampled included browsing an adult e-commerce store. Somebody complained and they issued alternate traffic to analyze for those who were offended. \n\nThe last assignment was somewhere between the first and second in terms of effort and required using an ML toolkit to analyze network traffic. Most of the code was provide to us, but it does take some time to figure out how things are setup. The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing an algorithm that was laid out in an academic paper. \n\nThis class is a decent option to fill a Computing Systems concentration requirement.",

Fortunately this part of the homework is the only homework / project that you actively need a math skillset; fortunately the instructor is very lenient on discussing the math section, to the point where a legendary student (who is also a math professor) walked the class through most of the problem and there was no complaint from the instructor.

However someone with experience in ML and ML4T can get by with no more than 10 hours a week of effort. \n- Math is a tough thing to get up to speed on but we have had some really engaging piazza discussions that solidified my understanding and the students really take it upon themselves to make sure their fellow classmates are in a position to succeed. It's great. \n- Instructor is very responsive and I have yet to see a relevant question unanswered by him. Hes got some great experience in ML and does a good job of breaking down the concepts into digestible chunks. \n\nFinal takeaway is to definitely take this class if you are in the ML track but if you are already quite proficient in ML and R, this class may not give you anything more.",

For those who are concerned about the amount of time the class consumes, those times are mostly based on students satisfying all project requirements, studying to do well on the exams, and completing the extra credit. If the curve is consistent from semester to semester, you can probably cut quite a few corners and still get an 'A'; if you are only shooting for a 'B' you can do even less (do so at your own risk!). \n\nNote: The structure of this class is learn about an abstract OS concept and then develop an application that uses that linux implementation of that OS concept. For example: learn about threading -> implement a program that uses linux pthreads. This is not a class where you have to implement the OS construct (I think that is reserved for AOS).",

With one month to go, I do not think I would recommend this course over other courses which have deeper roots in math. The lectures are full of high level concepts and the ideas seem very familiar. It feels like a lot of the material is stuff that most students should already know, but with new terminology. \n\nThe Ravens project was interesting for the first and second iteration. Doing the verbal approach in the first felt like a direct application of the earlier AI concepts. Attempting the visual approach for the second felt less so. I have not started on the third part, but I have ideas on what to implement at this point, and it might not be based on any of the concepts in this course. There are some students that will be creating an AI chatbot for their third project, and they may find more success in using the material from this course. It feels like the Ravens agent does not have a feedback loop to improve itself and is therefore lacking in the learning portion of an AI agent. \n\nThere is a bit of writing required for this course. The reflection papers that are required with each project submission are not so bad, since the students write about what they implemented and relate it back to the class topics. The stand alone assignments were slightly aggravating, because you talk about the general topics and how they could potentially be used to solve difficult problems. The mid-term felt the same. It was difficult to judge how in depth to go into the problems. And it was also tough to know if the solutions were implementable. It would have been nice to do smaller coding assignments and write on those experiences. Although, I may be in the minority with this feeling, because from the peer feedback system I came across a number of nice papers filled with figures and well thought out solutions.",

The material was mostly review for me, although it had been a while since I used relational algebra and I had not have any formal training on functional dependencies before. \n\nWhile the material was pretty easy, the workload was not as light for me as it was for others. Every week or other week there was a project due or an exam to study for. The book is of limited value, but I recommend getting a copy to lookup some of the more obscure questions during tests. The 4th test was by far the hardest for me, so just because you demo'd your project to the TAs does not mean that you are out of the woods. \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned, some students had ProctorTrack issues with exam 3 and the TAs ended up dropping the lowest of our first 3 test grades to compensate. It is hard to say here who was at fault since the majority of us were able to complete the exam. There were also reports of students not downloading the diagrams ahead of time on the first 2 exams as instructed, which makes me wonder if there was not a bit of user error here. If you are in a graduate CS program and cannot figure out how to get proctoring software to work on your workstation, then you may be in the wrong field of study. It is possible that there were some technical diffuculties, but I am personally not convinced. \n\nAnother issue in my opinion is in regards to the weight that is placed on the part 3 of the class project. This is by far the most time consuming part of the class and is worth the same as parts 1 and 2. Based on level of effort alone, it feels like it should be worth what parts 1 and 2 were combined (i. e. double). \n\nOn a positive note, the lectures were pretty entertaining as the professor is somewhat of an amateur comedian. \n\nIn my opinion, this is good fit for those looking to obtain the Computing Systems specialization, even though my run of the course did not go off without a hitch.",

On the other hand, there very challenging projects solving these Raven's Progressive Matrices that you may, barely, use one hundredth of one of the course concepts but probably will just use math. It's a great course, but I wish it were more filling. \n\nLots of essays. If you can write well, you will dominate this course.

I especially liked the topics of incremental concept learning, common-sense reasoning, diagnosis, and some of the videos on biology-inspired design. I also think that while writing all of those papers does get a bit old, it lets you think creatively and try to apply the topics which were learned in lectures. The experience ends up being a bit shallow since you are writing a single paper on something and then moving on, but I guess it is hard to expect more from a course that covers so many topics. The do provide a ton of extra material for you to go read on your own, and some people do that extra work and seem like they get much more out of the class if you are willing to put in the effort. \n\nA lot of the negative comments others make about this course are definitely valid. Some of the lecture material is just not deep enough, and I find myself tuning it out. This is my 6th course in the program, and I haven't had that problem very often. In addition, the three-part Ravens Matrices project gets old. I also feel like the \"no image processing experience is required\" is technically true, but I feel it would be awfully useful to have that experience. But the biggest problem with the projects is that it is hard to apply what was learned in the lectures beyond the first couple of lessons. I don't think this is specific to the problem being solved, but it is the nature of the requirements and the amount of time you have. \n\nOn a final optimistic note, I think that the alternative project 3 that was proposed is much more suitable for the course and its content. I hope they continue to have a Ravens Matrices project in the beginning of the course, but move on to the conversation agent for the second two projects. I think this would line up nicely with the ordering of lectures. \n\nIn the end I'd say I liked this class, but it was far from my favorite.",

The class was project based, with each of 4 projects worth 25% of the grade. Up to 10% extra credit was available through an additional project or PT exam. Overall fairly easy to score very well provided you don't biff more than one project. \n\nProjects focused on web security (similar to InfoSec, JavaScript), network based malware analysis (also similar to InfoSec), Network Monitoring (used Snort and Wireshark) and using ML techniques for anomalous traffic detection (no previous ML experience required, Python). \n\nThe slack study group and other students were particularly helpful on Piazza, and the Teaching staff did what they could to help students and generally were responsive and helpful. As is becoming the norm, the Professor was less present as Prof. Lee now has multiple classes running here in OMS as well as the terrestrial requirements at GT. This did not present a problem. \n\nThere is no required textbook, but taking InfoSec first is listed as a pseudo requirement. While it will make your life here very very easy to take Info Sec first, you can probably get through it without doing that if you have a CS background and have ever dealt with security in a job. \n\nOverall I would recommend taking the class.

The first is doing a frame busting exploit and creating a Chrome extension/exploit with Javascript. I have never used Javascript before and found it easy to Google what I needed. Youtube videos helped with creating the Chrome extension. \n\nThe second project involved doing malware analysis using some command line tools and Wireshark while running malware in a VM. If you have not used Wireshark you can find some how to Youtube videos to show you how to find data in packets. \n\nThe third was doing some more packet analysis with Wireshark and writing firewall rules using IP Tables. This project along with the first two took less than 10 hours each. \n\nThe fourth was implementing an exploit in an IDS by modifying some Python code. This one took me the longest to do of the four (about 15 hours total) but ended up only being less than 20 lines of Python. Most of it was trying to make sense of what the exploit was doing from reading a couple white papers and figuring out how to code it. \n\nWe had the option to either take an optional final exam or complete and extra assignment for 10% extra credit! You could choose 1 of 3 projects. I chose one that was an extension of the second official project in the class and only took me an hour and about 4 lines of Python code. Another one that looked interesting involved doing a port scan of the entire IPv4 address space for vulnerabilities. \n\nIf you liked the IT Security class you will like this one.

It has some issues, but fortunately they are ones I think will be resolved in future iterations of the course. \n\nThe course stands alone very well, and covers the necessary background material needed to be successful without needing to take other classes. If you have taken CN, InfoSec, and NetSec, you will find much of the material to be review. What is unique to this class is how this pertains to the realm of cyber physical systems like Programmable Logic Controllers, and how these devices are used in a conventional industrial plant. \n\nThis semester the course had 3 projects, each taking between 5-8 hours to complete. Each focused on it's own area - Ladder Logic Programming, Industrial Protocols, and exploiting vulnerabilities in CPS. There was a one hour midterm consisting of multiple choice and T/F style problems. I have yet to take the final, but it is 3 hours long, has a similar format and length to the midterm, and is comprehensive. We are permitted to use a single sheet of notes for the tests. \n\nThe material spends a lot of time focusing on definitions of terms, policies, and best practices. It uses common terminology, so much of it will be familiar, just applied to a new realm. The videos are high quality, easy to understand, and you can tell Professor Beyah was well rehearsed and polished for their production. There are a few moments where I felt like I was watching the Turbo Encabulator video, but it wasn't too terribly distracting. \n\nThe course also has some pacing issues. With only three short projects, straightforward material, two tests, and ~50 students this semester we probably won't get higher than 300 threads in Piazza. I think the inclusion of meatier projects / more projects is likely to occur, and would benefit the class. \n\nIf you are looking to prepare for the course, you could learn Wireshark if you don't already know how to use it, and potentially buy the books in advance and do some casual reading.",

The videos were well put together but after the initial assignments did not have relevance to the course. I liked the idea of the assignments taking you through a realistic software design and implementation case. Each assignment built off of the previous one as far as requirement modifications by the client with the final assignment ending with the product that you slowly designed throughout the semester. \n\nI rated this class low because I think the class was harder than it needed to be. There were 3 issues I had throughout the semester: \n\n1. Feedback (aka grades) was delayed throughout the semester. The assignments were ordered as design1 --> implementation1 --> design2 --> implementation2 --> finaldesign3 --> finalimplementation3. The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue. HOWEVER, i will be FAIR and say that instructors were very active on Piazza. \n\n2. Grading was vague and seemed to vary alot between TAs. The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation. However, they did not provide us the test suite they used for the grading until afterwards. This seemed unfair and led to much controversy in the class. \n\n3. I found that most of my time was spent coding rather than focusing on the best design. In fact, UML design patterns were not emphasized at all in this course and due to the feedback we were not sure whether our design was okay until late in the semester. I do appreciate the instructor giving us the opportunity to code a little more but it was almost too much for a course that should be about design.",

Overall, although there was the occasional video, where concepts were smudged over, very good quality of lecture! The papers were not an easy read, but pay off with knowledge in the end!

This was my first OMSCS course - I am an intermediate Python programmer at best, with a decent networking background and no real major programming background. This course was challenging without being too bad. Some weeks I spent 20-30 hours, some weeks less than 5. More of the former though. \n\nThere were 8 projects for 60% of your grade, which alternated between pretty challenging (coding wise) to more read/report which were interesting but easier. If you have a significant coding/Python background you have a big advantage, but otherwise they will push you. There is a lot of reading: academic papers, book, and background that took up a chunk of time I did not expect. \n\nThe course is a really good course, especially for a first one in OMSCS. Konte as a professor was great with feedback, Michael Brown as a head TA was great on that as well. The rest of the TAs, Michael, and Maria Konte were simply fantastic overall. Incredibly responsive on Piazza. \n\nThe tests are 40% of your grade. Although Test 1 was pretty random and not super representative of the material, Test 2 and Test 3 were much better - challenging but very fair. Just do not think you are walking into an easy A. \n\nOverall the course was great! I learned a lot, and feel like a stronger Python programmer.",

It's not like they demonstrated this passion once in a while but I've noticed the trend consistently through out the term; they've gone out of the way to explain things be-it assignments that each TA handled or holding office hours, answering questions on piazza etc. Not once did I feel a disconnect from the class. One thing that impressed me the most was Thad spending 2. 5 hrs giving a walk through of midterm; something that we don't see too often by any Prof of that class & calibre (such things are generally dealt by the TAs). Almost all the TA's were highly motivated, fun to work with on assignments & were highly responsive on piazza (sometimes even on holidays) & the best part was they are all humble enough to learn from any occasional mistakes that happened in setting up assignments or questions in the exams. \nThe course is pretty loaded (especially if you are working fulltime). There are 6 assignments, 1 midterm & 1 final exam. The assigments were all challenging covering various areas of AI. This is my 4th course & clearly I've spent the most number of sleepless nights(almost) during this term :)\nBoth the midterm & the finals are open book format & we had a full week to submit. This meant the questions were pretty open ended & challenging. Found this format of exam very benefitial. Gives you an opportunity to review the material well before answering. For once, it felt like it was testing what you know and not the 2-3 closed book formats which was testing more of what we don't know/remember. \n\nOverall, I'll recommend the class highly if you wish to explore & know more of what AI, ML etc is all about...",

The grading is a little wonky, because only your best 5 assignments count, and your final grade is based only on your overall standing at the end of the class. Anything over the overall course mean was an A, and the B cutoff was generously below the mean. \n\nThe lectures are a patchwork of old content from Thrun and Norvig and some new modules with Starner; production value is good, but the new content is often superficial, and it seems to be read from a script. (I'm not saying I could do better, but there are better lectures in the OMS program at this point). \n\nContrary to other posters, I found this class to be a constant frustration. The projects were error-laden, and the staff participation on Piazza was below-average; however, office hours and instructor participation in the class were much better than other classes. The projects were not particularly difficult (similar to RL or CV), but there was not a single graded exercise this semester (assignment or exam) that didn't contain obvious mistakes/errors. Sometimes the staff would acknowledge the issue and make a correction, and other times... not. \n\nIt was not beneficial to start the project early (because of the errors), but it also didn't always pay to start them too late because they would often make changes to the assignments after they were officially released. The autograder (i. e., \"Bonnie\") used to grade assignments would get overloaded the weekend that assignments were due and cause all kinds of reliability problems. I think the Bonnie servers are Udacity infrastructure shared by all GT classes that use the system, so large classes (6601 started with 400+ this term) and overlapping deadlines cause issues. \n\nGive it another couple semesters to work out the bugs before taking this one.",

The quizzes are gone, but now the projects have a little bit more meat to them. The exams aren't terrible, but require you to actually do the reading (that's not a bad thing... ) and watch the lectures. \n\nMy only real complaint is it seems like some of the projects were in flight or being modified as we went. The last one was delayed due to issues for example and ended up being replaced. \n\nOverall I'd take this class. If you've had no exposure to Python (like me), it's a good way to get your feet wet.

I found the projects to be pretty entertaining, and they definitely helped me hone my basic image manipulation and Python skills, but the knowledge required to solve the problems was almost completely independent of anything learned in the lectures. That being said, the lectures were fairly interesting, but they also seemed to be taught at a pretty high-level. I feel like I came out of this class with a slightly better general understanding of what they were trying to teach, but I have no idea how I would apply any of it. That being said, the production value of the lectures was great, in my opinion. They were easy to follow along with, and the little exercises kept me engaged (this is my first OMSCS class, so perhaps this is the same for the other classes as well - I don't have a comparison). \n\nThe assignments and exams were all written papers, which is fine with me. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I feel that was appropriate for the material in this course. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you're interested in AI, specifically relating to human thought. The TAs and professors were exceptional (Ashok is a great instructor who clearly has a passion for this subject). However, the slighly disjointed structure of learned material vs. the application of that material left a bit to be desired. It was all very interesting content to me, but it felt a bit shallow. \n\nI selected 6 hrs/week as an estimated average. Some weeks were heavier than others, and then there were weeks when I didn't really do much at all. The course was pretty easy, in my opinion.",

There was something due nearly every week, with projects of varying difficulty and with tests definitely requiring a good amount of time to study, as they included a lot of \"short essay\" questions, were timed, and proctored (via ProctorTrack). \n\nI found this class very enjoyable because it didn't include a lot of \"busy work\" - most everything we were asked to do led to learning something valuable. The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn't understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many. \n\nI'd say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material. But it is all doable and largely enjoyable. Definitely recommend.",

If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this class. As for me, I was a little disappointed that the class didn't cover the design and implementation of RDBMS themselves, only the USE of database management systems to implement databases. IE. we didn't learn anything about how MySQL itself is implemented, but instead we learned a process and theory of how to model data using MySQL, if that makes sense. \n\nI will say, Dr. Mark is a very good instructor. The class videos were great, and the TAs were attentive and helpful. I wish Dr. Mark would offer an algorithms class, I'd love to take that :)\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI see some people said the tests were easy, I felt the tests in this class were brutal. The questions were *very* nitty gritty and subtle, and the multiple choice was usually given so that at least two of the answers were very close to the right answer. I studied at length and still averaged a B on the tests. The project was also a lot of work. I had a good team, which helped, but the grading seemed a little arbitrary. Coordinating with other team members required a lot of time and effort, just to keep track of who was doing what, etc. \n\nSome context, because I imagine a lot of you guys will be in the same situation. I think if you had a traditional CS background and had already taken an undergrad DB class, this would probably not be much new, and that would make it a lot easier. However, I am a self-taught programmer with no undergrad background, so there were a lot of little things about the relational algebra, calculus, etc, that I'd never seen before. This class was a good way to pick up a lot of that \"light math\" stuff, since the practical examples given in the class made it a little easier to absorb.",

The instructor works at Netflix and has great experience, but IMO didn't teach much from his real-world experience.

I didn't find the class too difficult and it served nicely as a companion course in a semester where I needed to take two classes. \n\nWhat I enjoyed:\nI found the material covered in the course quite interesting especially in the second half of the course. \nThe majority of the assignments mapped to the material quite nicely with the exceptions listed below. \nThe tests were somewhat difficult but really helped solidify my understanding of the material instead of being an exercise in memorization. \nThe TAs (and other students) were helpful on Piazza. \n\nMy concerns:\nThe first assignment didn't align well to the material covered in the lecture. It's not a major issue but it wasn't clear what they really wanted us to get out of the material based on what was on the exam. \nThe last two assignments were too easy and didn't feel like they required an understanding of the material to complete. \nThe last lesson (dynamic-symbolic execution) didn't have an associated assignment which was disappointing. \nThe lesson on type systems didn't have an associated assignment. \n\nConcerns I heard from others:\nThe class sometimes requires you to use outdated APIs that are no longer supported/poorly documented. I agree with this but it wasn't a major headache as I've had similar experiences with other classes. Just know what you're getting into. \nThe APIs are difficult to get set up. I used the class VM and kept up on Piazza so this wasn't an issue for me. \nMost of the material was recycled from a course offered by Stanford. I think that the material/assignments can be freshened up a bit per my comments above but this doesn't bother me. \nLack of involvement by the professors. I agree but I think this is normal for many other classes I've taken. The TAs were helpful and the profs were active on Piazza prior to exams.",

With enough research, you can find some good sources to get you going in the right direction if you're strong suit is not at the system level of programming. Project 2 is decent and includes some malware analysis. Project 3 is possibly the best I've done in my few classes, heavy on the math behind cryptography (public key). It is very interesting and was created new for this semester. P3 is very interesting, I'm sure all will enjoy. P4 is also pretty neat as it revolves around internet security exploits. \n\nOverall workload for this class is pretty manageable. 5-10 hours a week. One major help is the bonus project, which can add 10% to your grade. This can cancel out a bad project or two if you need it (projects were 15% of our grade, tests 10%). \n\nThe downside during Fall 2016 semester was inattentive TAs. Our third project was released two weeks late due to all the TAs forgetting about it. It's likely that the professor will be more active due to this management gap in future semesters, so I wouldn't worry about it in the future. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this course.

I don't have a CS degree so had never taken an OS course. This was also my first course in the program. \n\nThe class is extremely well run. The TAs are very active and helpful, and both Piazza and Slack are active and great resources. The lectures are thorough, well done, interesting, and generally translate well to the material needed for the exams. The projects (with the possible exception of project 2) are well done and very helpful to understanding concepts. \n\nThe style of the exams was multiple-guess and fill in the blank, timed, proctored (ProctorTrack), taken through T-Square. The questions needed some improvement, though. Some of the questions are a bit nit-picky, and some are written in such a way that I spent more time debating the intent of the question than figuring out the answer. \n\nAs for workload, the projects consumed most of the time I spent on the course. When I was working on a project I might spend 20+ hours a week on the class. Otherwise it was less than 10. To be successful on the projects I'd recommend starting early, being comfortable writing C in a \nLinux environment, using the command line, and debugging with GDB. \n\nLast, don't cheat. One of the TAs mentioned that they caught something like 10% of our class cheating on the projects. That's ridiculous. Start early, keep at it, and hit the Slack channel when you get stuck. You can survive a bad grade on a project but a course F due to cheating might end your time in the program. Don't be dumb.",

The lectures are a combination of old videos by Norvig/Thrun and new content by Thad Starner and head TA Shelly Baghi. The quality of the new content is amazing, with subtle jokes and animations; the old ones are poorer. Along with the book and lectures there is additional material usually linked to from the week's overview or some assignments, or by other students on Piazza. You might also find more content online; I personally liked lectures from the AI class at UC Berkeley (http://ai. berkeley. edu/course_schedule. html). With practically everyone drawing from the same book, you'll keep running into the same examples over and over again but sometimes having it explained by another person just makes the idea click. \n\nThere were 6 assignments, with best 5 counting towards your grade (worst score is dropped). They require you to understand the algorithms in theory and be comfortable with Python. They usually consist of several parts, starting with basics and progressively diving deeper, offering bonus points for implementing advanced algorithms described in attached papers. The assignments were the best part of the course in terms of learning but at the same time could be very annoying when you're trying to find a bug in a complicated algorithm. It's just not the type of problem you can solve quickly on StackOverflow. \n\nMidterm and final exams starting with our semester were open book. They each took about 10 hours to complete and motivated you to consult the book/lectures to fully understand the topics before committing to an answer. \n\nOn average I spent about 10 hours per week on the class (counted by Toggl) but by no means it's an easy class. Unless you're a skilled programmer and used to watching lectures at 2x speed, you could easily end up needing twice as much.",

I found that if you want to learn the subject, it is a much better use of your time to review the 'optional' reading. \nProject - Based on solving the RPM problems, split into 3 iterations. Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza. The real complexity of this project is not KBAI - it is Computer Vision (they don't allow you to use CV libs yet it's not listed as a prerequisite)\nAssignments - I actually like writing, so these I enjoyed. It is a lot of writing, and I found that looking at the Winston book really helped me learn the concepts. At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don't actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions. \nMidterm/Final - Essentially a more advanced version of the assignments. Our questions were about chatbots, and a metacognition component that could explain our RPM agent's decisions. Fun if you like writing, and they definitely chose good subjects. \n\nThe tragic thing is that this course has so much potential, as the subject matter IS interesting and all over the news. You saw the excitement at the beginning of the semester on Piazza in the active discussions. Those fizzled pretty fast. \nI do hope to improve the course offering they 1) eliminate RPM as a project and replace it with something that actually uses/teaches the kbai concepts 2) redo the lectures to actually teach the material (with proper level of detail)",

Lots of quizzes built into lectures that actually solidify your knowledge retention. I learned so much, and covered so much breadth as well. \nProjects - I really enjoyed these as well. It is all C programming and I've never done C, so there was some growing pains in the beginning. I recommend you at least take some intro to c course, and definitely review c strings (and what the str* functions do vs mem* functions), and pointer management, and the difference between c strings and buffers. Those were the gotchas that seemed to get majority of the Piazza posts. \nExams - These were pretty difficult. A lot of gotcha questions as well. You could know the concepts yet still do poorly on the exam. Also the midterm only covered a small portion of the material.... and that left the majority of the material for the final. And that was a lot to study!\n\nNow the best thing about this class was actually the unofficial slack channel. The TAs hung out on there and were so active, always responding to questions, carrying on discussion of concepts... I do wish I run into more classes with TAs like these. \n\nThe worst thing is the amount of people that thought they could get away with cheating in this class. The TAs here spend considerable effort at discovering and pursuing cheaters, on both projects and exams. They take this issue very seriously and managed to catch many. It's unfortunate that so much of their time and effort had to go into something that shouldn't happen, instead of on grading and improving projects. Be a considerate person, don't cheat.",

This might not have been so bad, except for the fact that the two major projects for this course don't really match what has been taught in the lecture videos. That means that in order to actually get through the projects, you pretty much have to go out and learn some pretty difficult material by yourself without any instructor support. With better instructors and projects that better mapped to the lectures, this could have been a really great course. As it is, I would steer clear unless you're looking for a course with a relatively low time commitment to pair with something harder and don't really care too much about learning anything.",

I learned a ton about how computers actually work, and even though I am a front-end Javascript developer, a lot of the stuff I learned somehow kept coming up at work. Now that I've finally finished, I really want to go back over everything to solidify my knowledge. I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of specialization. \n\nPrerequisites: I wish I had spent more time preparing for this course by learning C better, and doing the 'C for programmers' course on Udacity. I'd also recommend going through the free online book 'OS: Three Easy Steps' (it's pretty short, and there are exercises that go along with it). If you do this, I think you'll get a lot more out of the course. \n\nLectures: With a couple of exceptions, the videos are good but can be pretty abstract. The most enjoyable lectures were the ones that tied into the projects very obviously. You can get away with only watching the videos, but for a fuller understanding you will need to read the recommended textbooks and do a fair bit of googling. \n\nProjects (40% of your grade): I found the first project very difficult indeed, and I think this is one of the reasons why this class has such a high dropout percentage. However, if you can mash your way through project 1, then you should be able to get to the end of the course with a good grade, as projects 2 and 4 are much easier. Project 3 required a few late nights too, but at this point you should be better at C. Start early on P1 and P3, and do not underestimate them. \n\nExams (55% of your grade): The two exams (midterm and final) are short, and while I found the midterm relatively easy, the final exam covered a lot more material and was acknowledged by most of us to be pretty difficult. If you follow along with the recommended schedule (which I didn't), you should be fine. \n\nSlack/Piazza (5% of your grade): Very active/helpful TAs and professor.",

It is the most brutal and most rewarding class that I have taken in OMSCS, and it is the hardcore class I expect to see in a top MSCS program. I personally learned a ton from this course and loved it very much. But be aware of the survival bias. Every two weeks, there were students withdrawing from this class, and only 30+ survived till the end of this semester. \n\nFirst half of the class is about 4 homeworks. Within two weeks, you need to learn new tools, watch tutorials online (in addition to lectures and labs) and finish the coding assignment for each homework. Don't be misled by the difficulty of the first homework, which only takes less than 20 hours of work if you are good at python. Homework 2~4 easily costs you 60-80 hours each. If there were no such intensity, I would not have learned so much in less than 2 months. \n\nSecond half of the class is about a research project on a topic of your choice. Personally, it's my favorite part. At this point, most survivors should be familiar with all the big data tools (spark, hadoop, etc. ) and getting ready for the real meat of this class. There is a pool of topics for you to select, and you are also free to come up with your own topic. Your task is to use the big data tools you've learned to \"reproduce and improve\" a recently published journal paper in the field of Big Data for Healthcare. Given the complexity and shear size of the data, even partially \"reproducing\" other's work is not as easy as it sounds. You can secure a good grade by simply reproducing the result itself. From what I have read as reviewer (you can see all papers of the class), most people couldn't get to the point of matching the published papers. \"Improving\" basically means a publishable work, and very few (maybe 2~3 per semester) can meet that standard. \n\nYou need true passion and serious commitment to succeed in this class.",

Speaking of the group project - I had a wonderful group and really enjoyed the group assignments, however some had a more negative experience. We were not allowed to select our groups so you have to make the best of what you are given. \n\nThe four weaknesses of the course were 1) VERY slow turnaround with grading. 2) The rubrics were not published and some of the grading seemed a bit nit-picky. There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren't entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn't something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren't until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours. \n\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches. You will have completed some interesting white and black box testing assignments, and you will get a good start on Android development if you have never dabbled in that before. The professor and TAs are genuinely supportive. This is a relatively low-stress way to get back into an academic environment after being out of the classroom for many years.",

Office hours weren't recorded for some reason when they were held, and the majority of grades weren't released until after the final was over making it hard to gauge one's progress. The SESC code base used throughout the class is horrific coming from someone who has worked in enterprise for a few years, and sadly the majority of the projects were spent just figuring out what was going on in the code vs. actually implementing and having fun measuring different aspects of the project questions. One project involved modifying the simulator in a file where ~20-30 lines of code directly pertinent to the project didn't even work correctly, and was effectively dead code that misled students. Luckily the main active TA Nolan was awesome, super-responsive to questions and helped clarify a lot of the confusion over Piazza. All lectures were just on a virtual whiteboard with a short intro/outro by the professor, and I would have appreciated a bit more production value like in Computer Vision where there is a mix of slides/camera angles/reading to break the monotony a bit.",

If you had a good grasp on the lecture material it takes maybe 3 to 5 hours to come up with a working solution, though I spent 20+ hours trying and failing at the extra credit portion. Then the class ends with a larger project that definitely requires you to comprehend and do research beyond what was covered in the lectures. You can work alone or in groups up to four. I valued working in a group to be able to bounce ideas off others. In the end probably spent 5 to 10 hours a week for the five weeks we had to work on it. There was also an extra credit option where you actually build a robot and implement some of the ideas of the course, though unfortunately I did not get time to engage with that aspect of the course. \n\nCompared to other classes this one had a less interaction with staff or other students, perhaps because enrollment is smaller and there were less assignments.

The remaining assignments were not usually as bad. That being said, I got A's on every single assignment, so if you have the time to put into them, you should be able to do well. The assignments consist of both programming and a report. The reports have little writing, but it's a TON of parameter fitting. In some cases, finding the best parameters is harder than coding the algorithms. \n\nLectures\n\nThe lectures were informative and funny. However, there are so many of them that it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. Most of them are not directly applicable to the assignment, so there is a temptation to skip those. I do not recommend that. \n\nFinal\n\nThe final was weird. 15% of our grade, but it was under 40 questions. Most of the questions were not that hard. The study guide given to us covered most of it (though, no collaboration on the guide was allowed). In my opinion, if you found much of the lecture content going over your head, then it is absolutely necessary to study for the exam. \n\nSuggestions\n\nTo me, the #1 pre-req for this course is strong programming skills. Everything is done with Python, numpy, and OpenCV. If you don't know Python, this course could be a struggle for you. I picked up numpy and OpenCV during this class, but any experience with those tools will help you. #2, brush up on linear algebra. Many of the assignments require it. However, you'll find that the assignments explain much of it for you, and the TAs may help you with it during office hours. \n\nSo far, I have also taken KBAI, ML4T, SDP, and Networks.

Some algorithms such as Z-order curve will blow your mind. \n\nThe class has video lectures, reading text-books/publications and assignments. The Prof gives guidance on what to do each week, and you must follow that schedule if you want to do well in class. Office hours are held every week, and you must make full use of it. \n\nThere are 5 assignments, all of which are not at easy, even for the experienced C/C++ developer. You develop your project on a VM provided by the class, and then test it on an IBM super-computer, for which you are given access. An initial performance benchmark is provided for most of the assignments and your grading depends on the performance metric. Its better to start the assignments as soon as they are released. After submission, each assignment gets a 48-hour window to improve performance. The class is set up for student to succeed !!\n\nExams are open-book, open-internet, but none of that is of any use if you don't master the subjects. They release previous semester papers, and you should refer to it while reading the class material / lectures.",

The projects were cool and make the student think and formulate informed hypotheses about the data.

My honest assessment of my performance was that I probably earned in the 65-75 range, but I was shocked to see that I scored in the 90s. It was very open-ended and I made sure to answer every part of every question, but I do feel like I missed the bar on some of the questions in which I received perfect marks. \n\nThese are good problems to have, I guess (rather than the other way around). \n\nOverall, nice class, and it's unfortunate that Prof. Lebanon (who produced the very nice lectures) will not be continuing as the instructor of record.

In my own experience as a software engineer, it has been sufficient to simply be on the same page as business partners and make sure you understand their requirements. Regular code reviews with senior team members and architects would help to ensure proper code design and quality. I have never once had the need to \"translate\" requirements into any kind of UML diagram. The assignments had a lot of \"busy work\" around this UML and in one case there was even an essay portion to discuss the pros and cons of various architectural styles. I actually found that useful despite it being a bit tedious. \n\nHaving coded in Java for many years between school and work, I found the coding assignments to be a breeze. Having the last two assignments be group projects really didn't help matters. I went all out on the last assignment to make sure the team would get high marks, even though I didn't need them. The last assignment was valued at only 100 points (10% of grade) but I feel like it should have been a lot more given the amount of effort that was required to complete it. \n\nThe lectures weren't particularly engaging and there was a requirement to complete all the quizzes in them to get full participation marks. After the first few lectures that introduce the student to UML and OCL, I didn't feel like I needed the knowledge provided in them to complete the assignments. Indeed, I watched the first two and a half parts, then never watched them again until I had completed *all* the assignments (only to get the participation points).

Here's the breakdown of assignments:\n\n10 quizzes - these are all easy and straight from the book and some lectures. Mostly quizzing you on definitions and a few characteristics of certain ideas. Very few times will you find a \"gotcha\" type of question here. \n\n4 Projects - Project 1 was a stack overflow exploit in C. I was new to both C and this type of attack so there were some growing pains here (plenty of resources online). Project 2 I had a blast with, we analyzed malware running on VMs. Project 3 was about decrypting keys using Python. This was a lot of fun even though the grading came back less than I expected, probably my favorite project I've done in this program. Project 4 was all about using Javascript to exploit XSS attacks. The gotchas in this project were a bit rough for me but I got graded really well. \n\n2 Exams (not open book/notes) - It seems that most of these questions came from different places from the text and lectures. At times they could seem like really minute details for questions but it is what it is. If I were to have to do this class over I would go through all the lectures and take notes. This would have helped me a lot. Also the proctoring was a hassle for some students (I had no issues). \n\nExtra credit project - this is offered to give you an additional 10 points to your final grade. Unfortunately part of one of the extra credit projects is totally a \"get all the points or none\" kind of or deal. Seems like an odd format for students who need additional help. \n\nOverall you should get a decent-good grade in this course. I enjoyed it and at times wish I could have focused more on certain aspects of InfoSec. A whole course on network security, or malware, or decryption would be a ton of fun!

And it shows. At the end of the semester, a student-run survey found that 15 students learned more on their own versus 2 students learned more from instructions. This is a lost of instructional goal. \n\nThe course composes of 2 unrelated parts. The first part has 4 assignments. The second part has 1 open-ended project. You are assumed to know Python, Scikit-Learn, HDFS, HDMR, Hive, Pig, Scala, Spark, GraphX, MLlib, Zeppelin. The provided environments are versions of both local and AWS Docker containers, and Vagrant images with CentOS, CoreOS, and Ubuntu. This gives a feeling of a kid playing with various toys and can't decide which one to take home. The issue is worse when you find out that the provided scripts don't even work out of the box! It is a lost of focus. \n\nThe open-ended project suffers from many problems. When the assignments are graded based on accomplishments and correctness, the project is graded like an English literature class. You can earn good chunk of points by making a video capturing your presentation skills, even if your project is a complete failure. Yet you don't earn any more point for taking more innovative or difficult approaches than other students. This is a lost of consistency. \n\nThis course is completely lost in the big world of data science. You'll be wandering aimlessly too if you follow this course. \n\nHaving said that, this course would be an easy A if that was all you'd care about. You just simply have to work really hard on it. It is a \"work hard, not smart\" kind of course that loses my interest quickly. \n\nGood luck!",

Learning how to learn under pressure itself is very meaningful for me. The first assignment and midterm are warning signs to tell you that you need to really dedicate.

            "text": "Several changes were introduced this semester to address many of the concerns raised by students in previous semesters. \n\n- There were no graded homework assignments. Instead, there were problem sets which students were free to discuss on Piazza. \n\n- The absence of graded homework assignments was compensated by more exams. Instead of 2 exams, there were 5 exams! However, each exam covered only three weeks of material at a time, so it was manageable. \n\n- There were several supplementary YouTube videos that helped clarify concepts that were inadequately addressed in the Udacity lectures. \n\n- There were several office hours and, unlike in the past, these were available for viewing on YouTube at later times. \n\nIn my opinion the above changes were a big improvement over the previous formats and this was clearly manifested in the smaller withdrawal rate and improved overall grade distribution. The final grade distribution was:\n\nA \t101 32. 0% \nB\t115 \t36. 4% \nC\t10 \t3. 2% \nD\t3 \t0. 9% \nF\t0 \t0. 0% \nW\t87 \t27. 5% \n\nThis does not mean that the course has been compromised and watered down. Rather, by streamlining the content and redesigning the grading criteria, the learning process has become less burdensome and unnecessary restrictions and time sinks have been eliminated. The course content is still the same, so students still have to put in several hours of work. \n\nPersonally, for me, this course was a great learning experience. I took this course by itself so I was able to manage without too much stress. Since my undergrad was not in CS (I have a masters and PhD in Aerospace engineering), I prepared for this course by:\n\n1. Reading \"How to Prove it\" by Daniel J. Velleman. \n\n2. Watching the Harry Porter videos series (based on Sipser). \n\n3. Reading up on the basics of graph theory and related algorithms\n\nEventually, despite not having a math or CS undergrad, I was able to score 97. 33% at the end of 5 exams. So with the right kind of preparation, anyone do well in this course.",

So unless you are GREAT in Java programming (I mean, you need to be a Guru in Java, being good enough just won't cut it) please do yourself a favor and skip this course. Mind you, they don't teach you Java on this course at all. \n\n2) All projects are cumulative which is not a bad thing but they take their sweet time to grade and return the previous projects, so if you make mistakes in the previous ones you carry them on to your next projects. So it is a double whammy!\n\n3) One TA admitted to me that they were instructed to be extremely stringent in grading. Tons of marks were deducted for very flimsy reasons. Regrade requests are entertained but usually doesn't change anything. No motivation to study, correct the mistakes and improve at all. \n\n4) Tries to cover a lot of topics without giving sufficient, valid examples (eg. OCL). And then you get dinged for that (for something you were never taught to begin with!). \n\n5) Absentee professor. Professor doesn't teach this course. He doesn't appear in any of the course videos or lectures and rarely visits Piazza. Office hours are conducted by TAs and sometimes the professor pops in there. In the 8 OMSCS courses I have taken so far, I have never seen this. The Professors always taught their respective classes. \n\n6) Do NOT expect any grade curving. Even if you score 79. 99%, you will get only a \"C\". For some other courses you can easily get a \"B\" or even \"A\" for 79%. \n\n7) As another student pointed out, this course is way out of touch with the real world.

It is well designed and executed, touching on a variety of very fundamental CS concepts that are relevant to many other courses in the program. The instructors and TAs were readily available and concerned with students learning the material and being able to make it through. The lectures and papers covered a lot of material, particularly after the midterm, so it pays to stick to the schedule even when there are no firm deadlines. Two of the four projects (1st and 3rd) can be quite time-consuming, particularly if you aren't strong in C. I found the grading to be fairly lenient on the assignments. About 2/3 of the material happens after the midterm, making the final challenging. There were several extra credit opportunities, and the instructor indicated that there would be a fairly healthy curve on the final grades, so there is room to make mistakes and still get an A. \n\nThe one weak spot of the course, in my mind, was the second project, which seems to have evolved over time, but is still hanging onto an accompanying Udacity sandbox that is irrelevant, at best, or misleading, at worst. The grading for this one also struck me as strange. I see the point(s) that the project was trying to convey, but think that it could be accomplished better in a different format.",

In fact even the projects are not too hard, it is the exams I found to be particularly different from all other courses. The exams only have problem solving question with some heavy arithmetic. A lot of practice with formulas is necessary. You not only need to know your formulas but the questions will wrong-foot you at every turn. Hardly in real life we get situations where one has to do HPCA arithmetic within a quick turnaround time. And that is what this course's exams are about, doing HPCA arithmetic within allowed time constraints. Well I am not saying the arithmetic is not important but the course turns it into something like a race at Olympics which I think is not necessary. I would say that if you know your formulas well you can do very well in this course sometimes even if you don't understand the concepts well.

However, I strongly advise against skipping any videos (cause you'll need to go through them for the final). The lectures contain a lot of mathematical proofs and derivations, so it might get a little dry. However, Professor Bobick did an excellent job of explaining them as well as the concepts and intuition behind all the math. \n\nHomework: There are 8 hw sets. HW1 is only 4% because it is easiest. Other hws are 11% each. In my opinion, HW2 and HW7 are the hardest (so get started early on these). In general, the difficulty of the hws is not in the coding, but it is the parameters. Getting the code to pass the autograder is not a difficult task. However, you'll have to pick the right parameters to produce the right images for the report (the reports consist mostly images and sometimes, short discussion, not essays). Optimizing the code was also a problem for me because I had no CS background. Overall, I don't consider the homework super-difficult. \n\nOther comments: Piazza and Slack are valuable resource, so take advantage of them. Most of the time, when I got stuck at something, the answer was in one of the Piazza's posts. Also, do watch the Youtube Office Hour videos. The TA explains how to do the hws very clearly and in detailed in those videos.",

Fall 2016 upgraded the difficulty level of this class both homework-wise and project-wise, in addition to adding a final exam. There was a homework every week or two that usually took under an hour to complete, and three projects throughout the semester that took 40+ hours to complete. Two of those projects were replicating paper results, and the other project was actually implementing a RL algorithm to play a video game to land a spaceship. This was a pretty cool class and definitely worth taking, but don't expect it to be any easier than ML.",

I would heavily suggest self teaching some of the material beforehand. \n\nThere was a homework assigned each week, but not collected. Try your best on each problem and then look up the student answer on Piazza. This is probably the best approach to learning how to do these kind of problems. \n\nThere was an exam every 3 weeks (5 exams total) and these exams only covered the past three weeks of material plus we got a \"retry\" question from the previous exam. So each exam had one question for each week of material plus one optional retry question which covered a topic students did poorly on for the previous exam. I never did the retry question so that I could have more time to work on the required 3 problems for the exam. You have 2 hours for the exam, you also were allowed a one page handwritten note sheet for the exams. \n\nYou will need the famous CLRS textbook as well as the Intro to the Theory of Computation book by Sipser. Both books are pretty good. \n\nProfessor Pryby made some very helpful supplemental videos and office hours videos to go with the legacy Udacity videos from the previous course professor (I think his name was Charlie). \n\nOverall I prefer \"code slinging\" over theory, but this class was a good change of pace (6th OMSCS course for me).",

So again, it is best to start very early when studying for the tests -- do not cram!\n\nThis class was definitely challenging but certainly worthwhile.

Overall, IOS was a great class for learning more about Linux OS internals, developing against a Linux VM, and getting familiar with the whole OMSCS process. I’ve been out of school since 1995, so this was a nice way to ease back into academics. \n\nThe course grade was 25% midterm, 30% final, 40% projects, and 5% Piazza participation. The midterm covers the first 3/8th of the lectures, and the final covers the last 5/8th. Both tests used lots of multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers to be selected.

Dr. Ada and the TAs were great overall, and the autograders for the coding projects were very good. \n\nOver the 16 weeks of the course I spent the following hours per week: 16, 27, 19, 5, 9, 14, 12, 11, 28, 11, 14, 7, 16, 0, 17, 12.

So, for most of the course, you have to guess how you’re doing based on whether your projects passed all the autograder tests.

Was never a very studious person... \n- Married w/ 2 kids under 5, full time job. \n\nThis was my first semester in the program, and I took this class because I was in the middle of nowhere with no Internet for the first 8 hours of my low priority registration window - so I was pretty much forced to take this class. \n\nI thought the lecture videos were done very well. The TA was doing his best to be helpful and was for the most part responsive, but it was clear that he was overworked. The HWs and projects were not graded in a timely manner. Half of the HWs were not graded by the end of the course (though to the TA's credit, he offered to consult individually for students to see where they stand in the course prior to drop date). \n\nThe midterm was pretty difficult. The final was made to be no-notes, no-calculator, and no-scratch paper. The result was that it was a lot of hand-wavy sort of conceptual questions (poorly-worded questions like \"what would be the more likely outcome if... \" sort of questions) - which I do not excel in as indicated in my grade in the final. \n\nThe projects were not too bad if you have previous C++ experience like I did. But I question the usefulness of these projects in learning the concepts. But yes - in the end, you're interpreting thousands of lines of code and changing 10 of them. \n\nI think the biggest problem is that the subject matter was just too academic for me to relate to in terms of generating excitement. And plus it was just drinking from a firehose for 4 months in terms of the amount of material covered during the semester.",

This was my first course in the program and I really liked it! \nYou will learn about foundations in Operating Systems, some abstractions and work hard on programming assignments! \nTo me the best part was actually the programming projects, where you will learn how to code in C using a Linux VM. I've never worked with C professionally, just a few semesters on my undergrad. As a professional Java developer working for quite time, I found the projects hard but really interesting to do. If you are a developer you will find your way. It took me the first project me to adapt to the \"C\" style. Used and abused of logs in my code. Never used a debugger in this class... \nProjects 1, 3 and 4 are about writing some programs in C. 2 Is about a performance evaluation. \nProfessor Ada and TA as awesome! They are there to make you succeed! So if you work hard you will get there... \nA few things to improve:\n - Project 2 descriptions are ambiguous. Although its meant to be straightforward, the way the questions / possible answers are written were confusing. \n- I found exams to be overvalued. 55% for 2 exams are too much compared to the project's workload. \nOverall I learned a lot enough to improve my developer experience.

He not having a CS background had a tendency to spend to much time explaining fairly simple concepts. This was reflected in the early assignments too. Generally, people are correct that this can be an easy A. However, if you end up with a bad group this class can be extremely time consuming. I ended up spending an enormous amount of extra time coding this as a few team members did very little and one did absolutely nothing until the day it was due. Due to it, our project ended up being way less than it should have been and felt that our TA was pretty nice to us given the circumstances. With that said I put a ton of hours into it and was very frustrated with how it turned out because of this. Still did get an A which makes me feel a bit better about this but in some ways not happy that the guy who did almost nothing probably also got an A.

The instructor, Dave, is really involved and will probably write to much instead of not enough. TL;DR will happen some, you can't help it. There is no real videos as it is all about the conversations hence the didn't read above. Also, I think the Peer Reviews were mostly crap as most didn't really provide any input anyway. I always did but others just did an exercise instead of a way to help others. The project itself was incredibly open ended and the meat of the class. I thought there were alot of useless projects people took on, however, it might have just been hard to come up with ideas. Here is where you can get a lot or a little out of the class. The TAs and Dave are here to help you in this open ended way. The class is an easy A but it is what you make out of it. You can learn a lot or a little but depends on you. Interesting concept for a class (being lecture less) and has merit. Grading of a class like this does require a finesse which I am thinking is a little lacking at moment. Overall, a fantastic class by a fantastic instructor and would recommend. If nothing else to get use to how upper academia is done. My criticism is just to let people know what they are getting.

Many times, the exam questions tended to be very similar to some of the problem set questions. \n- Don't feel bad if you are not able to solve the pre-requisite questions. I spent a lot of time preparing for the course, but was not able to solve most of the pre-requisite questions. However, I ended up doing quite well in the course. \n- 5 tests actually made it easier as each week, we just had to master 3 different topics. There was no cumulative final. \n- Join the slack group. You don't need to be active, but do keep an eye out on the discussions. You will learn a lot here. \n- Listen to all the office hours (good or bad). \n- There are lot of external resources which are much better than the Udacity videos.

I would strongly recommend reading the academic papers assigned - although they weren't so relevant to the projects/exams, they were sometimes far more interesting than the textbooks. \n\nMy only complaint is easiness of the class - some of the projects definitely did not feel rigorous, especially in their programming component. But others may disagree, just my two cents. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this class, but definitely as a second class in addition to something else more challenging.",

Don't think that simply reading the text and watching the lecture will do it for you... treat everything like a project and don't stop until you've mastered everything inside and out. \n\nThe new structure introduced in Fall '16 did help: \n* The professor gave some good and pertinent lectures toward the beginning of the course\n* The professor and TAs offered some helpful office hours to help with understanding the problems (ask ?'s so you don't merely get a regurgitation of the text or the essence of the problem). \n* The professor allowed/encouraged communication with fellow students on the topics (working problem sets was key)\n* Outside resources were allowed for reference and to help build intuition when the lectures & text failed. \n* \"Re-take\" questions were often offered on exams to try to improve on previous scores. \n\nThis is a tough, but rewarding class in that you get to graduate if you are among the hard-working group that get's to pass it.

It has no tests, but focuses on a semester-long project that has various design and implementation phases. You will have to make a few UML diagrams (Class, Sequence, etc), write requirements, and develop the designed project in Java. \n\nIf you already have experience with Java, and are familiar with Object-Oriented concepts, this course won't really be hard at all. If you aren't very experienced with programming in general, I feel that this is a nice starting point to practice these concepts and learn in a very practical way. \n\nThe only downside were the lectures, which I didn't find too interesting, nor did they help me too much with the project per-se, except for a few ones that talk about UML Class Diagrams and others that talk about converting requirements to classes and methods. \n\nIn summary, this is a good starting point if you aren't too experienced with programming. If you are, but want to start off the OMSCS with a not-too-difficult class just to get an idea of how the whole program runs, this is a good option as well. However, I wouldn't suggest it to an experienced software engineer. For those students, there are other courses in the OMSCS that would teach them more useful things.",

Prof Ramachandran is a very passionate teacher and he monitors closely the class in Piazza. \n\nThe video lectures explain most of the concepts very well, however there are a lot of details not mentioned in the lecture slides. My advice is to print the lecture slides and take notes on the details from Professor's speech. These notes will be very useful in the exam preparation. \n\nThere are tons of papers to read, most of them are the details behind the course materials while some are supplementary.

He has prepared non-required activities where you can probably learn more without the pressure of trying to get a good grade. \n\nWhat I think went wrong this thus far:\n- Unpopular decisions made by the instructor team. Personally I do not mind that much, but it is very reasonable for most people not to like it. And with a class size so big, those small \"mistakes\" have bad effects in high order of magnitude. \n- It seems the grading rubrics are not tightly coupled to the learning goals of the homeworks (or at least what I thought to be the goals are). The most popular \"mistake\" was giving huge deductions for missing complexity analysis in an HW where the goal is to get acquainted with R. Or deductions for not giving actual numbers when calculating those values are just incidental to the HW and the main goal was to visualize those numbers (this one is very minor). \n\nI really hope things turn for the better soon. \n\nThe topics in the course were by the way not what I thought they were. I was thinking more on statistics: hypothesis testing, trend analysis (I think this one will be covered), knowing whether the samples are sufficient, blah blah. Stuff I would need if I want to do research and decide to do surveys, A/B tests, whatever. The syllabus was so short I thought there are a lot more in betweens. Not really, that is it. In the HWs, we were usually asked to give an analysis of results. But I don't really know how to give those analysis correctly, so I end up giving very vague analyses (weakly related, higher, lower). I am yet to see my grade for HW2. The Instructor Team has an aversion for vagueness, so I am not very excited about my grade.",

It felt very rough - there's little lecture and many assignments required considerable time searching the web to figure out things you needed that weren't in the class material. Students found the assignments ambiguous, and piazza questions were answered very slowly and not in a clear manner. The original professor, Dr. Lebanon, was swapped out for Dr. Chakraborty and I just felt he wasn't really prepared for the class. Assignment time started very short, but then ramped up to be very large. I found the 10 questions on project 1 were taking 9-10 hours each, which got to be a real problem. It felt like the instructors had not done the assignments themselves and didn't have a good understanding of their sizing, plus ambiguity and uncertainty in grading (only 1 HW was returned by week 8) made you tend to overdo everything. It's unfortunate because I like the topic and Dr. Chakraborty did take steps to restructure assignments, but the overall theme was \"too little, too late\". Also the syllabus is strange - the second half is all basic machine learning, and didn't feel like it belonged, while there was no treatment of visual esthetics - what makes a visualization look good vs. bad, how to style it best, etc. I would wait until this class is much more mature.",

The instructor, Maria Konte, was new and stayed in the background until near the end, but TA team was great and the head TA Michael was a superstar so the class moved along like clockwork, with assignments coming back regularly and useful feedback. Some projects were a bit raw out of the gate - fortunately, the students on Piazza were very helpful in finding and fixing issues to keep things moving.

A few classic examples: 1. what is the growth rate of different format of file size? (They graded with big(O) notation) 2. Describe your observation (grading notes released after three weeks of submission saying, you can't say A is bigger than B, you have to say A is 4% and B is 3%, so A is bigger than B). The answer is in the figure the students submit, but the reason most of us didn't put them in the final conclusion is the assignment didn't ask it in the beginning. \nDefinitely the worst course have been seen in OMSCS",

I had to withdraw since my first midterm grade was very poor and the instructor had no intentions of giving a curve even though the class average was failing! Nobody got an A on the first exam and the exam did a poor job of gauging my understanding of the material since it was all T/F questions with 3 ineligible Multiple choice questions (we could not see the diagrams properly). Despite all of the students complaints, the instructors simply ignored them and moved on. On top of that, we never even got the answer key for the first exam so I don't know what I got wrong (or could argue for any points back). \n\nThe mini projects could be fun; however, the lectures do not show how to solve them at all. I was very stuck on both thus far, not because it was necessarily difficult but because there was little documentation or little knowledge given to us about the project. On top of that, the VMs and instructions provided for the mini projects were very very poor and paltry when it came to details. I had to scour Piazza in order to troubleshoot some of the most basic issues with the VM (for instance, there was an Ubuntu VM given to us that had no taskbar and had I not known the command needed to use in the terminal in Piazza, I would've just been completely stuck). A lot of time is also spent configuring the VM, downloading files/applications, and installing everything just to begin the project - why the instructors/TAs don't do this themselves and then provide the VM is beyond me. \n\nI would strongly suggest to avoid this terrible class. It is sad because the material looks so cool but the lack of structure, direction, and overall unfairness of this class has lead me to believe that this is the worst class I have ever taken as a student (and this was my 8th class in the program).",

The assignments and class lectures loosely fit together, but not well. \nAs for the exams, the mid-term was open book, but the material on the actual midterm exam did not match that covered in the provided practice midterm, nor in the office hours \"midterm review\" sessions. Granted, you were given 3 hrs to complete the midterm, but when the average grade was somewhere between 27-32 out of 50, something is just not right. \nI decided to drop the course after lack-luster performance on the midterm as well as several assignments, also after asking professor / TAs for help or clarification. The assignments and midterm were returned with virtually no explanation of what was done wrong, making learning from mistakes difficult at best. Further, when approached, the TAs / professor gave generic answers that did not really help much. \nMy advice, proceed with caution if you choose to take this course.

You're provided with a scanner that gives you a tagged token stream and you have to write a top-down, table-driven parser, modify the grammar to make it LL(1) or as close as you can get, and produce four-address code that assumes unlimited registers as an intermediate representation. In the second phase, you perform register allocation and instruction selection and generate MIPS instructions. Although you learn code optimization, the grading emphasis is on correctness, not performance. \n\nThe project is coding-intensive. You can use either Java or C++ and are provided with a few default data structures that you may or may not use. Most of what you need you have to develop yourself. As it is a table-driven parser, your best bet is to write a code-generator that parses your grammar spec and creates the table, which is what something like yacc or ANTLR does, but you're not allowed to use those and have to write your own parser generator. \n\nThere is also a written homework every few weeks, similar to CCA in that you need to answer some think-cases, but much easier in that you’re just working through existing algorithms, not devising your own and proving they work. There is also a comprehensive final. \n\nAlthough it’s a first run, the course feels like a finished product. It is very well-run with clear requirements and the material is fantastic. Be prepared to do a lot of outside research to figure out how to get a working product unless you’ve done this before, but it is well worth it and extremely satisfying to see your baby in the wild. You’ll leave with the know-how to create your own basic programming language.",

If you have programmed in an OO language before, this class is a huge waste of your time. Several of the projects are tedious and are of limited value to programming In Real Life. \n\nExample: In one project the assignment asks you to write 30 black-box test cases for \"test-driven development\" - when you have the source code (that you wrote) right in front of you. Actual worthwhile tests that you might write in industry are frowned upon. The standard \"red-green-refactor\" is barely mentioned in one lecture, and never really asked for in any assignment. \n\nGrading is unbelievably slow. Assignment feedback (when you get it) is random and worthless. If you want an easy foundational class, go for it. If you want to learn something useful, avoid. This class made me seriously consider dropping out of the OMSCS program. \n\nI should say something positive. If you've never written an Android app, you'll get that opportunity. The group project is also somewhat enjoyable if you find yourself in a good group (which I did).",

One more project and final exam is remaining. The course starts out easy, first homework is very easy [introduction to R concepts and programming], second homework is moderate [introduction to ggplot2 and data visualization techniques]. The first project was analyzing movies dataset. There were ten questions with lot of subdivisions and each was equivalent to one homework. The third homework is implementing logistic regression algorithm from scratch and optimizing the code so that it runs fast thus enabling to train and test on the dataset given. I am new to ML domain, and the lecture covered in the video was not at all enough to complete the homework, I had to watch the relevant portions in Andrew NG's course to gain the intuition behind logistic regression. It was hard work but at the end, I felt good implementing the algorithm and training it. \nThis course starts off as easy and by the time you realize that the course is taking all the free time you have, it is well past the drop deadline. I would strongly advise students with no experience in ML domain to take this course as a single course. If you want to double up, it can be paired only with courses which are front loaded like the AI4R course. I have put 18 hours per week but that is applicable only to the second half of the course.",

He clearly does not take teaching nor this job seriously, nor concern about the success of the students. \nI have taken 4 classes, loved them all, but not this one. Arpana and few TAs (BTW, apparently we are all unworthy to TA Jiachen Yang) are clearly inexperienced and ill prepared. Awful communication skills, no rubric in assignments, students repeatedly complain having to read the TAs' minds but the staff so far provided no resolution regarding the issue. There are extra credit assignments that are worth 1 point each in final grade, but it's all 1 point or nothing, providing little or no incentive to complete the extra credits since they are poorly defined. TAs are poorly coordinate among themselves and routinely release contradicting information, which snowball into a sea of Piazza threads. No peer feedback, no exemplary work. Project 1 was due Mar 6, 2017, still haven't been graded as of April 4, 2017 due to some TAs dropped the ball. Not looking forward to the final exam which account for 30% of the grade. One big reason I join OMSCS was to avoid this kind of teaching. GaTech needs to evaluate the staff carefully to uphold and preserve the integrity of this program.

I was taking this class just to fill electives, but it's one of those classes where I was surprised how much I learned (and how much I didn't know). I'm not planning on writing kernel software anytime soon, but the understanding you get from the class definitely helps even if what you mostly do is front or backend web dev stuff. \n\nAs with most other of the challenging course, start the assignments early. The forums move quickly, so if you fall behind your classmates on the programming schedule, your \"I'm just starting part A\" questions will get a lot less attention if everybody else has already moved on to Part C. If you stay up or ahead of the assignments, then the forums will greatly assist you. (My C got a lot better because I was able to stay in the general flow of the class.

However, the mind numbing, useless and extremely tedious assignments and projects makes this course almost unbearable. If that wasn't enough, your assignments are all due at 8 am on Saturday. Therefore, you can almost guarantee that this class will ruin every Friday the entire semester. \n\nThe assignments are intended to help you master a certain topic, however most of them are extremely unnecessary, vague and time consuming. I've never wondered in the desert before but I\"m pretty sure this is what it feels like. Constantly wondering how you got into this situation, if you will ever see an end to the drought, wondering if you're just walking in circles and elation when you're finally done. \n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this class.",

This is sixth OMSCS course and by far one of the worst three courses I have ever taken in my entire life. I would quite the program if this were my first course. The content is very simple, some quirky R language, logistic/linear regression, and regularization for feature selection. The near nonexistence of course organization and lack of pedagogy make the course very difficult. Basically, the professor plays the video recorded by another professor and TAs do the grading without interacting to students. I requested clarification on Piazza via a private post. A TA replied after 14 days and with 3 reminders. The professor lacks basic pedagogic skills. There are a lot of ambiguities in the project spec, e. g., phrases \"describe as precise as possible\" are used in the project spec for HW2 instead of explicitly listing all items are required. Another example is that he asks the students to describe patterns in a plot and later we are penalized for not explaining the plausible reasons for the patterns according to the grading rubric. It is funny that the grading rubric is released two or three weeks after the homework were submitted. The project spec is so ambiguous that there are literally hundreds of posts asking for clarifications and contradictory information are posted by TAs and the professor. There is one TA responded students post with sarcasm and in confrontational tone. I believe this course is bad enough to raise attention from the school. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera is better alternative for basics. \n\nUpdate:\nConstant delay on releasing grade and even the final exam was released a few hours late. The last two extra credited assignment were obviously rushed out and questionably violating schools rules. Received \"A\", but this does not change facts.",

More time will be required if you are rusty on your networking skills, as you'll need to read the textbook to catch up on basic concepts. On top of that there is a project every other week, which usually doesn't require much programming, and took me 3-5 hours on average. There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes. \n\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career. \n\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn't involved as much as I'd have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it's a very well run course overall. \n\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying. I also would have liked to do more of the coding on the projects. Except for a couple exceptions, I feel like they hand-held a bit too much (mostly already implemented, you just run them and analyze the results).",

If you've ever taken a math class at the undergraduate level (something above calculus/any rigorous, proof-based course past middle-school geometry), you'll be fine. Get familiar with asymptotic notation and pseudocode syntax, and you'll be just fine. \n\nI have no formal CS background. I took one programming class in college, didn't like it, and majored in math. Later, I learned VBA for consulting, picked up some Java, and got myself a Dev position. And this is my first OMSCS class. But because I've taken math courses before, I've averaged 14/15 on the first four exams. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with how math classes are taught in universities, here's how they go:\nClaim: If [conditions], then [result]\nProof: Suppose [blah]. Then [... ]. Therefore, the claim is true. \nMoving on, \nNew Claim: [Stuff]\nProof: [Other stuff]\netc. \nYou'll get few examples per big concept, which means one or two per lecture. Expect to do most of the puzzling through the implications on your own, though the (ungraded) homeworks help put you in the right mindset and give you practice. \n\nIf you've never taken a math class at the university level, you're going to start out at a loss. Prep. Learn the difference between an intuitive argument (It works for these three examples, so I'm pretty sure it should always work. Besides, it just makes sense, you know?) and a rigorous one (For all objects in this category, equipped with these attributes and arrows, the following holds: [Stuff]. Therefore, in all cases, [other stuff]). Learn induction, contradiction, infinite summation, and whatever else strikes your fancy. \n\nYes, the administrative decisions are capricious and inscrutable, the lectures have flaws, and the Piazza will be devoted to commiseration and scarce on productive advice. There are problems here. But with a little preparation, you'll be just fine.",

If you are registered or waitlisted for this course PLEASE read the Spring 2017 reviews! \n\nThis class has been the worst I've taken in this program. I've rated this class as Easy because the contents are basic and the assignments are not complicated. This course should be seen as \"Learn R by example\". However, having a large class created dozens of different interpretations to the homework instructions that eventually led to great degrees of confusion. I have a perfect score in all returned grades so far and it has been because I've stayed away from Piazza and office hours. I just read and re-read the assignment instructions always thinking what else I would want to see if I was grading this assignment. I know that some will say it is not the student's role but the methodology of going above and beyond has worked well in this program. \n\nOne of the main issues this class had was amount of contradicting information given many times. In several occasions it was mentioned to us that the TAs had a hard time reaching the professor when asked to clarify. \n\nThe staff in this class needs to be evaluated. It was evident the TAs don't talk to each other and a few do not know how to handle students' queries. One in particular tried to seem tough in front of the class justifying their answers by telling everyone that this is GT (I agree with this argument). However the tone and level of sarcasm used in (their) posts came out as confrontational. You are an instructor and if you are part of the team that answers the forums you need to work on your communicational skills! If you are frustrated, take a break and answer a post in a couple of hours or take a walk before answering!\n\nAs a side note, there is a review here that claims the professor was blaming the TAs for \"dropping the ball\", That is not true, it was a TA that said that. \n\nTL;DR: Wait for this class to be reviewed by GT!",

            "text": "This was one of the two courses I took my first semester in OMSCS. I come from a non-CS background and do not code for a living (Im actually in recruiting - ie.. sales). I have never written Java, never been exposed to unit testing, heard of UML but never messed with it. I do have a lot of procedural based coding experience, as well as have developed a CRM using MySql back end in VBA. I have done some PhP/MySql too, but not much. \n\nI couldn't recommend a course more highly, especially for a new student in the program. Dr. Orso was a joy in class, was involved weekly, always available, active on Piazza, and the weekly office hours were fantastic. More importantly for me, the projects made me think. I always (once released) said - oh, this wont take long. Once I got into it - I realized that the assignments were a little more involved and thought provoking than I first thought. The only assignment that I really wish were reviewed was the Category-Partition testing assignment. We had lectures on the subject, we used the application; however, I totally see the value in the tool, but not sure I really understand the best way to choose and assign categories and parameters. \n\nAs for the group Android project, I hit the mother-load with group members! All 4 of us put in a ton of effort on the project, and our grade reflected the work we did. We started early on the assignments, followed the instructions, completed the writing / required documentation, and by meeting multiple times during the week all assignments were submitted and complied with requirements. \n\nIf I had one recommendation, to me, the group project (15% weigh) should have been weighted higher. I certainly worked much more on that than I did on the individual project (which had 20% weight), it consumed more weeks in the course, and was a much more comprehensive effort than the individual project. \n\nTA's were Great and active daily. This class totally flipped how I approach software development!",

Unfortunately for me, my reading comp is not what it used to be!!\n\nThe projects were great at demonstrating the subject material. However, from a non-CS background, they were INCREDIBLY (for me) time consuming, and occasionally frustrating. However, writing exploits (buffer overflows) and doing cross-site request forgeries, cross site scripting, sql injections - how cool! I havent written a line of C code in 25+ years, so learning some C and learning to use a C debugger would be helpful. I recommend starting early on the projects. Appreciated the optional extra-credit project. However, I didnt have time available during the semester (with the workload of 6300 and my job) to dedicate time to them. So, at the last minute I submitted half of the optional project 2. 5, and believe I got a few extra points to help the class average. \n\nDO follow the assignment instructions. I lost 10 points on the first assignment for placing an exploit file within my writeup, and the instructions said to attach it separately. My bad!\n\nI learned a tremendous amount in this course. Although there was minimal if any interaction with the instructor, the TAs were more than involved, had access to him (and in one instance interceded on my behalf), were highly knowledgeable and available daily. And, until the last project I didnt realize they had chat rooms during their office hours where we could get help when needed. \n\nI do have another security text I purchased a few years ago. I found the Stallings text to be an awesome asset to one's library. The book was great, and I feel was a key to the tests and quizzes. The second half of the class, given my overall daily workload, I was not able to keep up with the reading, and am cramming for the final. \n\n\nTo me, this should be a required course for anyone in CS. I look forward to taking the network security class.",

Regardless, the lack of timely feedback and consistency of assignment clarification led to a lot of unnecessary confusion. I'm all for an appropriate level of confusion regarding course content, as that's called \"learning, \" but this semester was a logistical mess. Props to Adrian Chang, our TA who went above and beyond in grading, Piazza responsiveness, and overall engagement. Tough to do for 500 students, especially when the prof was frequently absent or seemingly unreachable. \n\nRegarding curriculum only (in hopes of logistical improvement for future course iterations): I don't come from a math background, and could have brushed up on calculus before enrolling. I thought this course would be more focused on visualization principles. There was some ggplot experimentation with project 1, but it's mostly about using basic ML models and R to analyze data. Glad to get a first taste of logistic & linear regression, but am pretty convinced I don't want to use R or ggplot ever again.",

I learned a lot in this class and was inspired to learn more about computational investing. \n\nDr. Balch is awesome, and class/TA/prof engagement on Piazza was super-helpful.

Piazza forums was active and the TA were really engaged in answering the questions. This helps a lot in the assignment because the feedback for your submission might not be delivered on time for you to work on the next task (and most of the assignments are basically refinement of previous assignment). \n\nSomething that I think might be improved is to include modern architecture like microservices or SOA and more examples on the popular frameworks/tools for the implementation. It might be good since most of the students are working professional in the industry.",

The last piece of the project turns into a group project and you have to merge each members ideas/work together or start from scratch. I think this was one of the ONLY group projects I have enjoyed, mostly because everyone knew what they were doing and actually did the work. It was spectacular. Hardest part for me was some of the diagrams you have to build. A few of them didn't really have good samples so I had to do some comparison from the real world examples I could find and hope it correlated back to what was expected in the class. \n\nSoftware Architecture and Design is what I do for a living, so this class was a breeze for the most part. Completely forgot to turn in one of the projects (wrong date on my calendar, lost 15% of my grade right of the bat) and still got an A. Before this class I had a rather strong hatred for Java.

The projects were great and I watched all the lectures. But the quizzes, the exams, and the reading just did not help me learn at all. The hard part about the exams is that you really don't know where questions are coming from... quizzes? book? lectures? projects? all of the above? So that makes studying harder. \n\nWhat I liked about the course were the projects. They really helped me understand the material we were learning and I felt like I was able to really grasp some of the fundamental aspects of software security that I was missing from my undergrad. Since I had a computer science background these projects weren't too difficult. You'll need to know: C, Python, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. \n\nThe only other comment I have is that the TAs/Instructor didn't participate in Piazza as much as I would have liked. It made the whole semester feel disorganized. For example, the instructors didn't post anything about the first exam until 2-3 days before it opened. Makes studying pretty hard. They also didn't post anything about the final. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and learned a lot from it!",

This is not a bad thing, I actually liked this approach, but since its my first time, a lot of time spent is to learn to think in terms of ML. I read all the papers and most of Tom Mitchell's book - prescribed by the TAs. They are very useful to understand these concepts. One thing is assured - all this effort will not go to waste. Its rewarding because now I am able to appreciate what ML is all about. The only draw back is the course focus is not on implementing algorithms. But ofcourse if time is spent implementing them, then less time would have to be spent talking/discussing about them. In the past I have taken Andrew Ngs Cousera course on ML, ML4T and DVA. While all those courses are good in their own way, CS7641 really dives inside the different ML algorithms. For those interested in pursuing ML this is must take.",

I had completed half of the labs prior to taking the course and have taken all other ML / data courses in the program, so the machine learning and general data concepts weren't extremely challenging. The catch, though, was trying to drink from a fire hose in order to complete the homework assignments. The challenge w/ the assignments was picking up Scala, working with provided virtualized / containerized environments (for Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Zeppelin, etc. ) that weren't fully functional or compatible with the requirements of the assignment. Get ready to troubleshoot the tools you're given. \n\nThe instructor and TA were not at all very interactive on Piazza. IF we got an answer, it was often not necessarily answering the question given, wasn't complete, or so general the question needed to be asked again from a few additional angles. Many times there just wasn't a response. We completed our final project submissions and hadn't received feedback on an assignment submitted about 1. 5 months prior... most recent grading feedback was 2 months ago. TA office hours were non-existant... really were \"message the TA and hope for a response\". The prof' did host a couple opportunities to have a brief chat session to discuss the project, but this was about it. \n\nScala is nice now that I've done it, but was a bit of a paradigm shift for me, so work on it ahead of time. Aim to complete all of the labs prior to the beginning of the semester. If one could hang with the class pace of assignments for a little over half of the semester, then the 2nd portion was dedicated to an individual/group project and was much more tolerable as you could select/control the technology and environment to work within. Also, as w/ any course w/ a team project, vet a good team early. \n\nYou will pick up a lot of pertinent technology, but will work for it (find help early).",

Overall, it was disappointing that things did not work out well throughout the semester and hope there is major improvement planned by the next offering. \n\nIf you want to learn R and basics of linear and logistic regression techniques, it may be worth taking even.",

On the one hand it covers interesting material, and had one of my favorite projects in my academic career where we taught an AI agent to learn to solve a scenario on the OpenAI Gym. On the other hand I detest academic papers and this course puts a HEAVY emphasis on them. \n\nIn many ways this course felt catered to people who are pursuing careers in academia and not toward people who want to gain knowledge to solve real world problems, my assumption is most OMS students fall in the later. Two of the projects involved recreating results from academic papers. In addition, it is recommended that students read through 22 academic papers throughout the course. While you can survive the course without reading most of the academic papers, it shows where the focus is. \n\nHomework felt completely unrelated to lecture material, the time needed to do homework assignments varied wildly and some of the homework and project timelines were unrealistic unless you can stay way ahead of schedule. \n\nOverall, the course felt in some ways like a disservice to the material it covers. The course material is interesting and can be used to solve very cool problems like those seen on OpenAI, however it only spent a small portion of the time solving interesting problems.",

            "text": "In general, I really liked this course. The content was interesting, and the homework assignments were a lot of fun. \n\nUnfortunately, it was certainly not perfect. Each homework assignment focused on a different computation technique or aspect of photography, and the coding/interactive portions were a blast. However, along with each assignment, we had to complete a lengthy PowerPoint report. The report templates contained many relevant questions and topics to respond to, but there were also numerous \"busy-work\" questions as well, and we had to go into great detail for each question in order to get full points. \n\nOn the topic of \"full points, \" the grading policy was the worst part of the course. By completing all requirements in a single homework assignment, the max possible score was a 90/100. In order to get any portion of the last 10%, we had to go \"above and beyond. \" The requirement for this was extremely subjective, so maybe this was a decent idea in theory, but it didn't work very well in my experience with the class. In addition to this, the grading/late policy just generally had no flexibility, and it punished all students equally, regardless of whether they were truly lazy/incompetent or just busy with another work/life issue, which is likely more common with OMSCS students compared to on-campus students. Perhaps it was fair in a way - it just seemed overly harsh to me. \n\nALL that being said, the course was a ton of fun, and it was a great way to brush up on Python/numpy skills. It was somewhat more time-consuming than I anticipated due to the long reports required for each assignment, but it was generally easy overall, in my opinion. \n\nIf you're at all interested in photography or image computation/manipulation, give this course a shot. Hopefully the grading policy will get an overhaul at some point, but it's definitely manageable if you put in some extra effort. I imagine it will provide a good head start for the CV course, but I have not taken that... yet!",

This is particularly true when it is compared to CES 6242, a complete disaster reviewed separately, this semester. Jay is a great professor, he is knowledgeable, responsive, and respectful, though i have a different opinion regarding the exam questions (I run my own graduate course for four years in Europe). Of course, my old friend Will is great as usual, I will perhaps miss his long but detailed posts on piazza in the future. \n\nBeing a graduate course, the topics covered here are fundamental, but never assume an easy \"A\". This course, arguably, has the lowest percentage of \"A\" among all the OMSCS courses. The exam questions are purposely tricky. There were four exams in total, the grade mediums are below 80 (out of 100) except one exam. Though my grades are 2~4 sd higher than the medium, but I do not believe that tricky questions are good to motivate studies. Another thing I would approach differently is the course content, instead of emphasizing on EER diagram which is essentially a formalization to represent information, I prefer to dig deeper in more practical issues, e. g., query performance optimization, normalization, or non-SQL database. In addition, I suggest to remove exam #3 for SQL and move the questions to other exams, there are so many moving parts in the course, which makes it hard to follow. \n\nIn the group project, we were asked to build a fully functional web application with a database back-end. This is not hard but you have to invest serious amount of time. I am having a hard time to believe people only spent five hours per week can contribute much to the project. My advise is that pick your teammates wisely, preferably someone has previous experience on developing similar applications, and read the book carefully.",

The programming projects are based on 1) socket programming, general C, and multithreading, 2) IPC, and 3) RPC. The first two projects were sizable endeavors, and the third was much less intense. I had very little general programming experience (no industry experience, some C++ in undergrad, and some Python scripting). The first two projects took me about 50-80 hours each, I'd wager. \n\nTESTS:\nThere is no required text for this course, and all you get for material are lecture videos and papers. So studying for tests consisted of watching videos over and over for me. The tests themselves are kind of vague, but they are achievable, and you will learn a lot studying for them, but I would like to see more concrete test questions with less subjectivity. One \"project\" was a take-home quiz, where you decide on test parameters for some fictitious experiments. This one was super vague, and I would have much rather actual ran experiments and written a paper. \n\nLECTURES:\nI don't know if this is true about all OMSCS videos, but she waves her hand a lot in front of the screen, which causes the text to be projected on her hand. Not a big deal, but I found this distracting. I ended up watching the lecture videos over and over, because that seemed to be the best way to pass the tests. Would rather have been pointed to more reading. \n\nOVERALL:\nMy first course in OMSCS. I think this class was great and was not too hard, even without much programming or OS experience coming in. You'll learn parallel programming, scheduling, file systems, memory management, IPC, Linux, systems programming, etc. You touch on some concrete Linux examples but I would have liked more.",

We surmised that it was a way for him to look and feel superior. No one was impressed. TAs were extremely combative to the point of putting people down because they just can (This TA has been named in another review here. Go look it up. ). We were graded, tested, and penalized for things that were not expected for this course and were not required in the contractual syllabus. When students brought this up, TAs proceeded to publicly shame students. Total arrogance and elitism were used in an attempt to quell dissent, but didn't work. This replacement instructor was a total embarrassment to the Georgia Tech Name and to PhDs everywhere. If the instructor had no intention of sticking to their deadlines, where do they get the right to penalize students for late submissions, when they, with their ambiguity, confusion, and off-the cuff comments, were the source of lateness?!?!\n\nIf we could give ZERO stars, we would. \n\nI feel sorry for the upcoming ML4T class in 2017 Summer and Fall.

Grade was determined based on 8 problem sets (partially auto-graded), peer feedback, and a final exam. Thankfully, the problem sets supplemented the material quite well, and helped me to understand some of the math and concepts that were discussed in the lectures. Even so, without a fantastic TA (Pedro) who hosted office hours every week to talk about issues in the problem set, this class would have absorbed much more time. To get over a 95% on the problem sets, you had to put in some work to show going “above and beyond” what was assigned. Typically, this took the form of an additional “challenge problem” in the assignment. These problems usually were parameter-tuning extensions of the original assignment, but could take several hours to complete. I should also note that several assignments required some amount of parameter tuning, which some find tedious and boring. While this may be true, it does accurately reflect the nature of the field. \n\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class to take. I felt I learned a lot of applicable material, but also felt like I had not absorbed most of what was discussed in the lectures simply due to my time constraints (also took CCA and ML4T this semester).

I was also able to understand material much better by just reading Sipser and CLRS and watching MIT’s OpenCourseware and UC Davis’ equivalents of the material. Having problem sets assigned solely as preparation for the five exams (each worth 20%) was great. We could propose solutions on Piazza and have TA’s or the instructor Chris Pryby (who were fantastic, btw) respond and give us hints and feedback. Tests were difficult, but fair, and there were opportunities to make up for some lost points on previous exams.

Assignments often took many weeks to grade, and made it difficult at the end of the class to gauge if I needed to attempt the extra credit project since 36% of my grade was unknown. It was nice to have a utility that could run automated tests, but it ultimately had no effect on the project grade. This class could benefit from a tool like Udacity’s Bonnie to grade student assignments and return grades in a timely matter. Dr. Balch and the TAs were somewhat responsive on Piazza, but they disappeared towards the end of the semester.

The written assignments were thought-provoking and the coding projects were challenging at times but doable. Knowing Python definitely gives an advantage. What I liked most about the course was the instructor's and TAs' passion for the content and interest in student learning. There were regular requests for student feedback on the course, and previous feedback seems to have been integrated fairly quickly (giving students the chance to do an alternate project for both projects 2 and 3). This course is very much what you put into it. You can get a B with minimal effort, assuming you are a good programmer, or you can spend 20+ hours a week diving deeper and reviewing the optional readings. I took the course for the enjoyment of it and got a lot out of it. The final exam topic alone was so interesting that I spent several hours researching after my paper was already submitted.",

Each exam question is an extreme deep dive into one of the many subjects this course covers then modifying one small feature of the subject and asking vague questions about it that you must infer a lot of what the TA was thinking when they wrote it. They also give you a week to complete the exam so there's no real studying for it and you should expect to spend 10-15 hours on it. The assignments are fun but don't relate to each other so you will learn a lot about the subject then completely erase your memory for the next subject. I enjoyed this class but the exams didn't really test anything other than how good you are at guessing. The professors doing the lectures are really smart though so the videos are pretty entertaining.",

Although I did wish we spent less time on R and include another project. \nThe homework and projects were fair with more than enough time, but once again people waited until the last minute to ask questions and panicked when they didn't receive a step-by-step solution to solving the problem... pathetic. \n\nThe only complaint I will make is that grading took way too long. However, if you really need feedback you can just ask the TA if your code is correct. Regardless, you should know if your code is working based on the questions, so the feedback is not useful except for stating why you lost a few points (maybe for not including enough graphs). \n\nDon't let other reviews scare you. \nI know I sound like a drop in the ocean, but being a GT alumni I know the difference between a good and bad course. \nThis is definitely the former.",

I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that. \n\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty. \n\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems. They were not handled in the best manner. Piazza became out-of-control negative. Communication from the professor was often sparse. CIOS feedback should be given to avoid this in the future. I am proceeding under the assumption the professor will take CIOS feedback to heart. But if he doesn't, I would avoid his classes in the future.",

Not exactly sure what happened, because the lecture materials are the exact same and I understand the assignments were almost the exact same. Sounds like assignments not being returned in a timely fashion is a valid concern, but I imagine should be fixed with future iterations of the class. But some of the complaints about the material and the ambiguity of grading seem unwarranted, I don’t necessarily expect a class to have to explicitly lay out grading criteria ahead of time and they weren’t in the Spring and students did not complain.

There was also an optional project which meant even if you struggled on a project or exam you could still fare ok. Project 1 was C-based, and having some acquaintance with C was nice, though I think one could manage if familiar with another language. Project 2 was not especially language dependent. Project 3 required some basic python skills. Project 4 required you to be able to read or write HTML, JavaScript, and PHP, but having only minimal familiarity with those I was still able to figure it out, so I wouldn't over-stress about those. \n\nThere was a ton of lecture material for the course, which got tiresome. In particular, the videos for the first half of the course are extremely long-winded and even at 1. 5x or 2x were quite repetitive. \n\nMany of the quiz questions are lifted verbatim from the textbook.

The projects were certainly a superior source of learning. \n\nThe most disappointing part of the course was that there was virtually zero instructor presence on Piazza or office hours. Luckily a couple of the TAs were helpful via Piazza or available for consultation office hours and peers were helpful on Piazza. I got the feeling on Piazza that students who struggled on the projects would have appreciated a lot more guidance and instructor participation.

The course is divided into three modules - basically numpy applications to finance, intro to finance, and machine learning (with a focus on finance). \n\nThe ML projects were the most work. It sounds like based on feedback, one of those projects was moved mid-semester rather than the end with the rest to attempt to distribute the workload a bit more evenly over the semester, which I thought was effective. Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I'd advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around. Typically around a week before the due date there are some final modifications to the project requirements, which although annoying tended to be fairly minimal. I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course. Only once were these changes extremely substantial and disruptive (for the biggest project, no less), but all things considered I think this course was very organized and made it possible to start projects much sooner as compared to other courses I've taken. \n\nThe second to last project was a huge amount of work for me, but the rest were a manageable level of intensity. The projects largely build on each other (most projects reused code from previous ones), so it's essential to stay on top of them. \n\nThe instructors and TAs were generally friendly and very active on Piazza. There was around a week near a critical deadline where they vanished which proved to be quite frustrating for many, but in the end I think being very active 15 out of 16 weeks vastly surpasses the quality of interaction I've found in other classes.",

            "text": "Warning about previous reviews: I found many of the claims in previous reviews to be INACCURATE: that the exams didn't test student's understanding, that the exams didn't look like the practice exams, that the assignments lacked specifics, that the lectures didn't help with the assignments, or that the documentations of libraries/frameworks/tools for the assignments were lacking. \n\nThe exams and assignments' questions were among the best quality in all of the classes that I've taken so far. Mid-term and final exams tested concepts from the lectures, were straightforward and fair. There were no trick questions. If you paid attention during lectures, took notes, and spent the time to understand the concepts, you would do exceedingly well (I scored in the 90%s for both mid-term and final; it can be done!). In fact, for a couple questions in the final exam, the answers were directly in the lecture notes, and so you could literally just copy and paste!\n\nThe lectures were excellent and provided all of the (basic) fundamentals to work on the assignments, and you would fill in any gaps by reading the required readings mentioned in the assignment instructions. Again, if you took notes during lectures, and did the readings, then the assignments would feel straightforward. This doesn't mean that they were easy, but at least you wouldn't get entangled in the concepts, and would instead be able to tackle the \"puzzle\" head on. The documentations on the libraries/frameworks/tools were sufficient and clear. \n\nIn summary, this is an excellent class on static and dynamic analyses. In addition to the application, it covers theoretical aspects: does an analysis terminate; is it complete; is it sound; can we do better, and if so, what the trade-offs would be? You will learn a ton, and end up with a deeper appreciation of static/dynamic analyses--the sort of things compilers and IDEs do to optimize/analyze your code. Also, Dr. Pryby and the TAs were responsive, fair, helpful, and awesome.",

I didn't technically meet the prerequisites, never having had a networking class in my undergrad curriculum, but I wanted to use my first semester to maybe try to get some of the more fundamental topics squared away. \n\nI learned a fair bit about how the internet worked, and the introduction to software defined networking was fun to play around in. But I could feel that the class was kind of in an awkward state right now, perhaps transitioning somewhat from a heaver focus on SDN when the course was first designed. Lectures referred to projects that were no longer part of the course, for example, and I'd say only the last two of the eight projects really involved playing around with SDN. \n\nThe remainder of the projects concerned fundamentals (e. g. graph search over a topology) or were follow-along demonstrations of topics we read about in journal articles. These latter projects really required no coding -- you'd just follow the instructions provided and write up the results. \n\nSome of the projects were newly designed and had bugs, but those were worked out and time extensions were given where necessary. If they keep the same project structure I don't expect that to be a problem in later semesters. \n\nA couple other reviews say the tests were hard. I didn't think so, really? I got As on the first two but a C on the final, so maybe they were adjusting the difficulty as they went along. Then again I didn't really study very hard for the final since I was focused on my other course... \n\nMy \"5 hours\" is a guess; I didn't keep track.

The instructor and TAs all seemed great and response time to questions and concerns was near immediate. But I acted like they didn't exist except the few times I had a specific question, and I suspect my learning suffered for it. \n\nThe lectures comprise the bulk of the learning material, along with journal articles assigned for most lectures. Most of those aren't too difficult, skewing towards older and easier to digest articles. Ada's a great lecturer and I have few complaints about the quality of the lessons. The recurring \"toyshop\" metaphor felt like a gimmick and wasn't particularly edifying, however. Some of the topics chosen were a little mysterious -- it's unclear to me how remote procedure calls, for example, are a good topic for an OS fundamentals class. \n\nYou'll spend most of your time on the projects. If you know any C at all they shouldn't be too difficult... though through a combination of poor planning and lapses in intelligence I couldn't figure out the synchronization necessary for Project 3 and received an extremely low score. Avoid my mistakes and start early. Each of those projects should be an easy A, if you're careful with your time and ask for help. \n\nThe tests, on the other hand... There are two and they jointly account for 55% of the grade. They are also pretty tricky IMO, so take 'em seriously. Also make sure you understand and can work out the problems from the lecture quizzes that need to be done by hand, some of those will surely come up. \n\nAll told I'm glad I took the class. I'll likely get a B, but if I'd applied myself a little better an A would have been achievable. More importantly, I've grasped the fundamentals well enough to have a base for continued learning.

My first mentor was great and we had lots of discussions on my research topic at the time. If you form a group, you get assigned a new mentor and that's usually the mentor that most group members have (if there's one or is random otherwise). My group's mentor was really hands off (as in I actually got 1 personal communication the entire time he was assigned). We didn't hear much from him throughout the entire project and our team's grades was always late. \n\nThe class allows you to research/work on a project that you want as long as its related to ed tech in some sense. There were some really interesting projects and I believe group work here helps a lot. While most of the time group projects are kind of a bane, this is one of the classes where it can really help you come up with something that you'll never be able to going at it alone. Just MAKE sure that your group mates are as interested in the idea/project as you are.

All this being said, I feel like I would have gotten an A or a B in the course had I kept with it, but it would have put too much of a strain on my mental state. \n\nThe content itself is genuinely useful and interesting. I have little or no complaints as far as that goes. Several of the TAs did seem to go above and beyond the call of duty to try to salvage the class. You will read a ton about the R language. If you have experience with python Pandas library, then it should be (somewhat) familiar. \n\nMy advice to potential students is to wait until they fix the class to take it unless you need it immediately to fulfill the ML specialization. My advice to GT is to cast this class back into the abyss. \n\nEDIT: Also, the extremely positive review below is bullshit. The complaints about this class are legitimate. Many of the people \"complaining\" (including myself) have successfully completed many OMSCS courses without the kinds of issues experienced in this class.",

The requirement was never placed into the documentation, but it was apparently explicitly told to the TAs like some sort of \"test\" that the students be able to intuit exactly what the instructor was thinking. \n\nOverall, the class was great, but it left a very sour taste in my mouth at the end for Professor Balch.",

He find every opportunity to give out extra credits. I learned little from this course.

Don't worry about some late criticism you may read here about \"unclear\" requirements -- while not perfect, they were plenty clear for anyone who was paying attention -- that is to say, most of the class. [Hint: if it's a Classifier, it has to pick categories, not averages. ]\n\nWhy not a perfect 5? Well, as mentioned the materials have been evolving to put more emphasis on the ML section. But what starts as well-produced, clear instructional videos gives way to a lot of fuzzy, hard-to-read slow-paced recorded in-classroom lectures with the occasional low-budget office hours to give important assignment instructions. It all works, but it's a bit duct-taped together. \n\nOverall a continually fun and interesting class with phenomenal instructor involvement.",

It is a lot of material and overall it is very interesting. The grading was fair and was based on 3 projects and 2 tests. \n\nThe tests were short, multiple choice and T/F tests. In general I ended up studying all the material for a very long time only to spend 5 to 10 min on each test. The testing on ladder logic was not done well since there was no effort to give partial credit. This I feel is important when testing knowledge of a programming language. \n\nThe projects were the best part of the course, but still fell short of providing that much challenge in the class. The actual tasks pertaining to the material were quite easy, but sometimes it was the preparation that took the longest. My feelings after taking the class were that homework should be given each week to introduce the students to the technologies they will be using, like VirtualBox, Wireshark and the ladder logic emulator. Therefore the projects could involve more of the class material and less learning about the project environment. \n\nLastly, TA involvement on Piazza was good. They were there to answer questions or concerns. Since the class grading involved only 5 assignments Piazza was quiet most of the semester. \n\nI would like to see this class improve since the material is current and well-delivered.

Personally I thought that on the contrary learning about photography is obviously an essential part of mastering Computational Photography, which is also why I enjoyed the \"Camera Obscura\" homework that some people have criticized below. \n\nThe \"mandatory\" part of the assignments is pretty easy (I recommend learning about advanced indexing in numpy, which makes most of the coding trivial), but it only counts for 90% of your grade on the assignment. The remaining 10% is \"Above & Beyond\", which I find very motivating in terms of expanding your learning, and it can be pretty hard to get a full 100% on an assignment. Because that was what I aimed for, my workload was fairly high and the course was of Medium difficulty for me instead of Easy. If you just do the bare minimum, the course might qualify as Easy, but your odds of getting an A will be much lower. \n\nI haven't taken CV but it is clear that there is some overlap, so if you've taken CV you will probably have an easier time in CP.",

ML4T consists of three mini-courses: (1)numpy and pandas, (2)hedge fund and stocks, and (3)basic ML methods (regression, kNN, decision tree, ensemble models) and reinforcement learning (Q-learning). \n\nStudents may find certain sections easy or hard. For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction. \n\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn't require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642. \n\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments. \n\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn't bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks' questions.",

The course contents were actually pretty good though quite light. The assignments and projects were also OK. However, the final exam and the overall grading was terrible. There were a dozen TAs, but no grading criteria or rubrics, while all assignments and final exams were essay like reports... This created a total disaster. Maybe because the grading load was too much, TAs did not seem to spend much time on (or even care about) our tens of pages of reports, and the grading was generous but quite random, with no meaningful feedback given. In fall 2016 they put some example assignments on piazza and after the exam, some students voluntarily shared their exams, but similar answers were given very different scores. One of the answers that got full score was almost identical as mine, but mine got 3/11. After I pointed out that my answer was similar to others but got significant lower score, the professor simply said that happens, but since mine was not perfect, the original grading was valid. So in the end I stuck at 79. 7 with a C... \nAdditionally, after the final exam, many students found out that they were not able to see a big chunk of the final exam-a third of the exam didn't show up on proctor track... I still don't know how they dealt with these angry students. \nI filed the grading grievance and started to take the same class again, because I needed it to graduate. As of now, I haven't heard anything from the grievance, and the semester is already ended. \nSpring 2017 is even worse, the instructor disappeared for the most part of the semester, and we only got 20% grading done two weeks before the final. There were several angry posts on Piazza, and some students filed grievances. \nFor this semester, I simply resubmitted most of my assignments with a little editing. And I got higher than 100.

I came at this course after ML and RL, and have had previous experience in the securities industry, so I found this course pretty easy, but not without its challenges. \n\nThe good: The material is really interesting, and Prof. Balch is incredibly enthusiastic about the topic. You get an opportunity to implement some ML algorithms from scratch, and you learn a lot about the markets. Personally, this course is where I learned how powerful and useful Pandas and NumPy are. \n\nThe bad: Really, only one thing -- the assignments are subject to change as late as a week before they are due. Usually the changes only require a few minutes of work to implement, but it is frustrating if you are the type of student who likes to move things from to-do to done as soon as possible. \n\nI believe this course would make a good first course in the program. It's a gentler introduction to machine learning than 7641, and teaches some skills that will prove useful throughout the program. The finance knowledge is also fascinating.",

Out of 35 questions, 3 were on material not covered in the course, 3 had issues that caused the instructor to admit they were bad, and 2 had multiple correct answers. To make up for these questions, the instructor added 3 points to everyone's score and then refused to take any grade challenges. This solution is unfair and took many students from an A to a B gradewise. I was fortunate to not be one of them, but this class is the worst run class I have experienced out of 9 OMS classes - I am sorry I took it!\n\nThe on-campus course this spring looks like an amazing course, dealing with lots of big data technologies. Instead, we got a basic introduction to R, which I hope to never see again - it's that poor a language choice. This class really should be taught in Python and should cover more relevant topics like the on campus course.

They don't teach you on how to use testing tools out there in the market, instead, they teach you the techniques behind those tools. Lectures are very short, with few easy examples. Most quizzes are hard to crack. You suppose to infer the answers out of the poor explanation of the concepts. In most of the lectures, the lecturer only repeats what's on the slides word by word not explaining much of the concepts. You don't have supporting materials. If you google it, it's hard to find the concepts covered in lectures. There are only few external references. \n2. The assignments: what is hard about them is not what you have to accomplish, but instead trying to figure out the tools and topics under you have to perform. Topics like graph theory, pseudo machine code are necessary. You have to use deprecated tools that are uncommon in real life. It's hard to find documentation. You have to spend hours in learning those topics and tools before attempting to solve the assignments. The time slot is fair. Most of them have the expected output. Piazza is a great tool, and office hours help you a lot. \n3. The exams: they are open-notes. So, it doesn't not matter how many times you review the lectures, or do the quizzes or the practice exams, it will not help you at all. Exams are very hard. It is expected that you master the topics that were barely covered in lectures and apply that knowledge to unrealistic situations or algorithms. The mean for the midterm was a 32/50. You do the math. \n4. TA's are very active and very friendly, professor only showed up a couple of times in office hours. \nIn conclusion, it's a hard class because of the way it is taught, barely covering topics and expecting from you to become an expert. Be careful if you are going to take this course.",

I did have a bit of a crunch at the end of the semester, as I didn't have my full data available for analysis until about a week before the final project was due, which meant that I put in a lot of hours the last week analyzing data and writing. \n\nDavid Joyner describes this class as a mini Ph. D. and I think it's a perfect description. You explore your educational interests, propose a project, have it accepted, do the project, and defend your results.

I have a paper that is close to being ready for publication that I do intend to submit this summer to its intended journal.

I was excited about learning R and for the potential opportunities I would have to apply what I learned at my workplace. But basically the disorganized, disastrous mess of this class crushed my hopes and dreams. \n\nThings I saw in this class that I've never seen in other classes:\n* Constant contradiction between TAs and professor \n* 6-7 week wait to get a grade back for any assignment\n* TAs abandoning the course for unknown reasons leaving all the work on a handful of TAs\n* Zero guidance on assignment / project expectations\n* Material on final exam was no where to be found in the course\n\nAt the end of this course I basically lost some interest in Data Visual Analytics. It feels like a chore to me now because of how much I really disliked doing work for this class. I'll never forget the moment when the first grade was returned in this class. The Piazza statistics for the class showed that there were 6x the number of posts of a typical day when it was released. People didn't understand what they did wrong. And it took over a week for the instructors to generate any kind of reasoning for the grading. One would think that a rubric should be available to handle discrepancies... but it didn't appear that way. For the rest of the assignments, I felt like I had to perform 150% just to get a good grade on an assignment. For the second project, my report was 40 pages long. I did get an A but I honestly wasn't confident that I had done enough. \n\nThe professor did admit at the end of the semester concerns had been heard and improvements could be made. So hopefully they will be!\n\nOn top of the disorganization, this was also a hard course in general. Here are some things to review if you decide to tackle this course:\n* Machine Learning\n* R (the language)\n* Statistics\n* Calculus \n* Vectorization (specifically in R)\n* Big O",

I'm sure this changes semester to semester, but they seemed a little unprepared for some questions and spend half the time responding to questions via text while the recorded video was silent. This wouldn't be so bad if they hadn't used hipchat, which doesn't keep track of separate threads, so at any given point in the office hours there were 1-4 conversations going on at once. \nI learn a lot from test feedback, which we received little to none of. The midterm we got to watch a series of videos (for a few days) that went over the answers, but were never given back our answers with the scores for each. The final we received no feedback whatsoever. \nThis brings me to my final point... Until grades were released, I had no idea if I was going to get an A or an F... Seriously.

During this course there are two tracks you can take: research or development. Both require you to conduct a mini \"literature review\" before you can begin your final project. If you choose research you will either conduct your own study or find a new way to examine existing data/studies. If you choose the development track you will create a working prototype/product. There are really no lectures outside of a few at the beginning and then any others you choose to watch while trying to land on a research topic. \n\nThere are papers you must write during the initial research phase as you narrow down your topic. During the project phase you must do weekly check ins and two milestones. The final project is a paper formatted for journal publication, the actual project (paper or prototype), and then the actual files/research you used. \n\nI personally chose to do develop an actual prototype. I was given free reign to pick the platform and the features as long as I could justify them. I really enjoyed working on the project and was able to produce something I had always dreamed of producing. \n\nThat last point is something that the instructor specifically designed the course to encourage. During course feedback on Piazza I said at times I felt like I was paying money to work on a hobby project. He responded saying that was the idea. This course will give you credit for working on a passion project. You can then use the results for other endeavors: publishing, PhD, or even a start up. You will ultimately learn only what you choose to learn. If you want an easy A you could likely get that done, but honestly it would be a waste if you don't use the opportunity to push yourself.",

It was an easy A for me but I would rather have had the class be more challenging and actually learned more--I don't feel like I learned much beyond some very basic Machine Learning concepts. \n\nThe professor and most of the TAs were mostly absent from Piazza and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of response from them. The instructions for the homework weren't clear and it was difficult to get anything clarified. The TAs would tell us something and then the homework would be graded the opposite of what they had told us. TAs and professor would contradict each other all the time. At the time of the final exam, I had only gotten back my grades for HW1 and HW2 (out of 3 homeworks, 2 projects, and some additional extra credit activities). This was frustrating since some of the questions on the final were related to things we did in the homework and projects, and when I wasn't sure if I had done those things correctly I thus wasn't sure how to answer the questions on the final correctly. \n\nI got high scores on the homework and projects but I have to wonder if it's just because there was such a backlog of grading to do close to the end of the semester that the TAs just rushed through it and gave almost everyone As. I'm guessing at least half of the class ended up with an A, especially due to the extra credit--it may have actually been closer to 75%. \n\nI was hoping to learn a lot about data visualization but it was mostly just a tutorial in how to use ggplot2 and a short discussion of the different types of plots one can create. The lectures were very shallow and general--I wish there had been more of them. It was probably only about 6 hours of lectures total for the entire class. It just felt like it wasn't enough, and it also felt like the professor (who was NOT the same professor as the one in the lectures) didn't really care about this class at all. \n\nDISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The approach that the class takes on exams is to get you to take your knowledge to the next level, rather than testing what you learned directly. This could be a good thing or a bad thing; depends on how you look at it. \n\nThe assignments are okay. Their goals are really exciting (parallel list ranking, the N-Body problem, distributed communication collectives, TeraSort, and funnel-sort), but I thought the instructions were a bit lacking. I'd say I spent 40% of my time trying to understand the skeleton code, another 40% learning about the goal of the assignment, 15% coding, and 5% learning things about C. \n\nWhile working on the assignments I found myself more stressed out and frustrated than focusing on putting my knowledge into practice. However, they're continually improving this course, so I anticipate that this will change in the near future. \n\nI do feel quite accomplished after finishing the course, and for what it's worth I took this as my first course while working full time, plus my wife and I had just had our first baby a couple of months before the class started, and I was able to pull off an A. So if you're up for the challenge, then I say go for it, you're learn some really cool stuff.",

First two weeks of class is only about 5 hours but it ramps up quickly. \n\nIf you are aiming for an A the majority of your time will be spent on above and beyond (independent research) and writeups. Expect about 2-3 hours a week on lecture (take notes while watching!), 5 hours on coding for complex base parts of assignments, 3-5 hours on writeup for base assignment, and the remaining time on independent research (both coding and writeups). Also a variable amount of time on taking your own photographs depending on the project. \n\nThe course will be undergoing a revision this fall so hopefully the workload comes down.

But if you're really going for an A, then you'll find the class taking up a lot more time.

I went right into investing after finishing the course and made some decent returns :-)\n\nCons:\n-Starts off with hand holding and as soon as deadline to drop comes, workload significantly increases. I remember procrastinating on MC3P3 and ended up spending 20-30 hours on it. \n-Depending on your interest, projects in the end can become time sinks. I really tried to get significant returns compared to the benchmarks!",

For me, this also meant that I was unable to fully absorb lots of the concepts. The lectures are just \"ok\" in my opinion. In many sections the math is glossed over, which was a bit disappointing. \n\nThe \"Above and Beyond\" portion of the grading seemed rather arbitrary and subjective to me. For one assignment, I didn't even attempt the extra 10% and inexplicably got a 94 on the assignment. On the other hand, there were other assignments that I put 8-10 extra hours in and only received 1 or 2 points. Overall the process was extremely variable. Lots of it seemed like it depended on the TA you got and what mood he or she was in that day. \n\nMy biggest beef with this class was the final exam. This was unproctored and open-everything. This sounds great, but in practice it meant a bunch of questions with tricky wording. Even that wouldn't have been bad, but tricky questions were combined with poorly worded questions, making it hard to determine a question's intent. The final basically devolved into a digital scavenger hunt. I don't think it measured my knowledge of the material at all-- just how well I could use Ctrl+F. \n\nOverall this was a decent course. The homework is interesting and can be time consuming, so possibly try to take it on it's own.",

The first 2 weeks walks you through some useful features of python, numpy, and pandas. The pacing is excellent and not \"drinking from a firehose\". After taking one of those famed \"Baptism of Fire\" courses in OMSCS as my first course, this course was very nice in helping me gain back some confidence. \n\nFun Factor: Very High. The applicability of finance and trading (which I also have some personal interest in) made the ML concepts stick just that much better. \n\nI put down 10 hours / week, but it's really more like 4-5 hours a week - potentially even less if you already have extensive python experience. Much of the time was spent fooling around with the people on slack (whose experience and camaraderie, I was told, was probably never to be repeated in the history of OMSCS slack channels). There were extracurricular contests going on to optimize code, etc. that sucked tens of hours each week. \n\nProfessor Balch and a number of the TAs were ever present on Piazza which was very helpful. \n\nLike most other OMSCS classes, the #1 killer is procrastination. Many folks were apparently caught blindsided by some schedule \"squeezes\" that were not anticipated. Also, some folks were seemingly blindsided by not carefully reading the assignments. Every assignment has a grading rubric that serves as the specs for the assignment. Read those 3 times, then 3 times again before turning in the finished assignment.",

The lectures are mostly enjoyable to watch, with joking and puns between the professors, and only occasionally does it feel like the lecture discussion goes off on a tangent or doesn't represent the material well. \nThat's the good news. \nNow the bad. Grading is nonsensical at times, you may get contradictory feedback like \"You should have talked about X... \" followed a sentence or two later by \"I see you did mention X... \" and yet you will still get docked 20% without good reason. You will be told things like \"You don't need to memorize formulas\" and \"You won't need a calculator\" for the exam, and then the exam will expect you to have memorized a formula and do the formula calculations by hand or in your head without a calculator. The grading curve is complete nonsense, you can \"fail\" by traditional standards and still get an A in the class. The assignments will not come with complete expectations in the requirements, you may get some more of the requirements by bugging the TA's during office hours but it is still not guaranteed. If you ask for an example of what is expected you will be told \"No, because then you might parrot the example\" and the professor wants you to \"be creative\" except that the TA's will penalize you for missing something expected in the hidden grading rubric that they wouldn't tell you about or give you an example of. Responses on Piazza are few and slow, especially for such a large class. Slack is a much better source of quick information but it may not be \"good\" information when it comes to things like the hidden grading rubric. \nThe class seems to be run, and definitely graded, as though it were a meta commentary on the accuracy of machine learning in general. Putting in the effort that would get you 100% in other classes will inexplicably result in much worse results in this class even if you still get an A in the end.",

I would not say it was Maths heavy but it does require brushing up some basics and keeping them handy for proofs/calculations throughout the course. Prof. Pryby's youtube video lectures helped a lot during the initial part of the course. Video lectures on Udacity were dreadful. As the course progressed, I got a hang of things. Like others have stated, working on problem sets helped prepare for the exams. No matter how hard I prepared for all the 5 exams, I never felt confident before, after and during the exam, infact I always felt like I was going to fail. I somehow maintained 9s and 10s out of 15 throughout, which got me a B towards the end. It took me 4 tests to finally get a 5/5 on a question. I have to say that there were several moments where I felt like giving up, but I held on. I remember looking at the sample problem sets and exam questions before the course started; absolutely nothing made any sense. Just like everyone else, I too have learned a lot but at the same time I feel like there is so much I still don't know :)",

The assignments are generally very easy, and only sometimes require programming. The projects are huge time sinks. I really enjoyed the OpenAI Gym assignment as I used it as an opportunity to learn deep Q networks (not covered in the class) and thus had fun with the project. I still burned at least 60 hours on it though. The other projects involved implementing old RL papers, and I didn't enjoy these very much. \n\nExams: Just the final. Pretty hard to study for as there's a lot of material covered in the course. \n\nTeaching staff: Professors are completely AFK, but TAs do a pretty good job keeping the class on track. Office hours are fun though of questionable value beyond entertainment. You'll have to figure out most things on your own. \n\nGrading: Fair.

They're reasonably weighted, but don't have much value in terms of learning anything. \n-The Piazza participation requirement led to a ton of spam (\"+1\"s, memes, etc)\n\nBeing proficient in Python is a big plus. People also struggled with selecting technical indicators. Just don't over-complicate things.

There are word limits, so leave no word unturned and revise, revise, revise to fit that word count! Taking notes for all the coursework can be really helpful in your written work because you will need to refer to the concepts you learn in the lectures. \n\nThere is an individual project that you can complete over time, or within a week if you dedicate a few hours a day to it - I did feel a bit rushed to complete it before the deadline. There's a team project, and of course, YMMV based on the strength of your team. Be ready to learn how to write surveys or perform interviews, which can be challenging if you are lacking in soft skills!\n\nOne of the more interesting experiences you'll have with Dr. Joyner is that this is very much an \"open standard\" (not necessarily \"open source\") course. When students post feedback about the course structure, or something that didn't work quite right, Dr. J is extremely forthright about how he might change or improve the course.

            "text": "The summer schedule seems incredibly compressed. The first 3 assignments & the individual project were doable with the 1 week/submission schedule. However, the second phase of M assignments go through a complete cycle of a UI design, from needs finding to prototype construction and evaluation. Almost all of these all require input from an external group: either friends or family or the other students for the need finding and review activities. The same has to be done, this time in a group context for the group project. A little more time is allowed for the group project as it only has to be in at the end of the semester. \n\nThe logistics of that into a forced march of a 1 week cadence make this unworkable for me to integrate into work&school&travel. \n\nI think if one is able to dedicate a non Summer semester to this alone, it could be doable. But for Summer, I think the course workload is unrealistic. Just too much logistics which detract from the content. It would be better to have a single project, with enough time to get all the reviewers logistics organized and submit towards the end of the semester. I don't think it's necessary to have a group project. Any advantages from a group can be had from allowing students to review the various steps, and better yet, be able to incorporate that feedback into your work. (The way a real review at work would be used). \n\nBTW one disappointment is that in order to have a project you can use at work, you need to submit an application to an IRB of some sort. Again this throws in a logistical detail, as something like cannot be organized within a week, yet, that's all you have if you keep to the 1 week cadence. Without some incredible foresight or preparation, the whole thing is unworkable for a custom project. You basically *have* to take a play project, and use your fellow students as the users. \n\nBBTW I seem to be writing about a different course than the people below, perhaps the assignments were reworked?",

Before I took the class I checked the Workload estimate here, which was in my case underestimated. The workload vary depending on assignments, there were weeks with -/+ 30h, others with +/-10h. Overall, it was not an easy class. Piazza was too noisy and sometimes overwhelming to focus on the valuable posts. I believe this is common problem for all classes with large audiences. I hope the next classes will run smoother and better. More details: https://cse6242. gatech. edu/spring-2017/schedule/",

            "text": "I took this course with the thought that it would be about software testing techniques at the source code level. Although the first few lectures covered that material, the course then proceeded toward compiler-level analysis of source code. This was not what I was expecting/wanting from this course; I previewed the remaining course materials and decided that this course wasn't really going to be applicable to my interests/career. I've decided to withdraw from the course. I'd say that this course is more oriented toward OMSCS students whose background is in CS and compilers rather than a software engineering type. I thought the lecture material was fairly dry, and failed to provide much context for the concepts and algorithms being presented. I completed the first 3 assignments and felt that they were somewhat useful in reinforcing the concepts taught in lecture, but I spent most of the time trying to read the (generally sparse) documentation for the tool. This summer (2017), the instructors provided excellent midterm preparation material for the midterm exam, but the exam was still challenging (took me 2 hours to complete of the 3-hour window). I thought the grading was strangely harsh for some relatively minor errors (my opinion) in homework submissions. \n\nI feel like the course kind of hangs you out to dry on the assignments in terms of support. The lectures cover the concepts, but the assignments are basically \"Read the manual for this tool, and implement stuff. \" I've taken enough well scaffolded courses to know that this is not the best way to teach people (throwing them into the deep end). \n\nTL;DR: Overall, I was disappointed in the content of the course, since it didn't really focus much on software testing but mostly low-level analysis most suited for compilers. If you're into that type of thing, this course may be for you. I ended up withdrawing from the course for these reasons.",

TA is very prompt, rarely let a day pass with unresolved piazza questions, with clear concise answers. \n\nProgramming projects! Not for the faint of heart. Implemented either in C++ or Java. No starter code. As I understand, the summer version of the projects is a bit different than Fall/Spring which included more compiler phases but with starter code. Be very well prepared with one of those 2 languages. And explore data structures, you'll need to use lots of sets, vectors, stacks,... etc as well as structs. Projects can be done solo or in teams of 2, but we were strongly advised to work in teams. And having taken the solo option and spent tons of time to keep up with this choice, I recommend you find a team mate unless you're an experienced programmer. \n\nThere are 2 projects, the first is a front-end project where you implement a simple scanner, and implement a parser generator and an LL(1) parser. The second project was much harder, where you implement 3 methods of register allocation on IR code and convert the code into assembly, and simulate the assembly using SPIM simulator. \n\nThere were 4 HWs, that take a bit of time, pen and paper work, but they were excellent in measuring how well you undrstand the material. \n\nThere's a final exam, haven't taken it yet, but it should cover the entire syllabus. \n\nAs I remember Projects: 35%, HW; 35%, final exam: 30%\n\nPerhaps the only con would be the absence of an auto grader, and being given basic tests to try our code against, you will have to devise your own tests, otherwise risk failures with the grading tests. \n\nHighly recommended.",

            "text": "I'm like the person below. I wanted to like this course a bit as the content really goes into cutting edge subjects (AI). Point of perspective, the whole Deep Mind / Alpha Go think is built on top of the content of (RL). In general though, there is no teaching and it's more like a sink or swim class, more like you are generally expected to know the content up front (90%) and the remaining should be easily learnable. I definitely did not come in with any RL knowledge at all. I made it, but the way the course is structured made it a lot more difficult than it should be. \n\nNegatives:\nToo many lecture readings per week. Who has the time to read 3-5 academic papers a week and absorb the content? I understand maybe 1-2, but to ask students to read 50-100 pages a week is a bit much. \nHomeworks not useful. \nNo coordination between HWS and Projects. HWs usually prep you for a project. This is not the case at all in this class. They are almost a unnecessary distraction. \nProjects were graded on how accurate can you reproduce a paper. I think this type of grading is poor, considering the people that wrote the paper, have usually have significantly higher qualifications then an OMSCS student and probably spent a couple months creating the results of the paper where OMSCS students have around two weeks to hack around and get the same results even though yes the equations are in the paper but they take a long time to understand and figure out. \nTA office hours not helpful. \nLectures need to be cut down. Who really has time to watch 3+ hours of lectures a week. Streamline to 1-2 hours. \n\nPositives:\nTA hands on sessions are useful. \nProject's content are really interesting. \n\nIn general, the course has potential. The problem is it's really meant for folks right know with a basic knowledge of RL versus none. HWs need to be revamped to intro to a project, example, a HW could be done on linear programming with probabilities as a trivial example as basically project 3 that's all it's about.",

That said, I haven't taken the final yet, and I'm in the period that I dreaded all summer knowing that I didn't have enough time to watch many lectures or read papers outside of what was required for the homeworks and projects. Unfortunately, right now, I'm cramming facts for the exam (25 T/F with \"twitter style\" answer justifications). During the summer session you have something due every week, with 2 homeworks and 1 project released simultaneously every 3 weeks and I found myself not having much time to spend on anything else other than getting those done. I did the best I could to get the homework done as early as possible to maximize time spent on the projects. \n\nI disagree with criticisms of the TAs this summer. These guys were great, worked hard, and likely felt the pressure of the compressed schedule more than we did, especially since the profs were absent - the TAs completely ran the course (and did a pretty good job IMO). \n\nThe only ML background I had coming in was ML4T and I didn't feel that I needed any more than that as preparation. Its a good class, if you take it in the summer, know that it will be a lot of work. I spent a lot of late nights/early mornings and missed a couple of family events as a result of taking it, but have no regrets",

Instead, it asks you to memorize concepts, protocols, and several shameless plugs from the instructor. \n\nDon't let the first few videos fool you with that hard yellow hat or the substation in the background into thinking the instructor is passionate about the class. On the contrary, you rarely see him participating. There was a question from a student and he condescendingly answered \"I'm not going to debate with you but for other students, my statements were right. \" That surprised and roiled up many students. If there's anything you'd learn in this class, unprofessional attitude is surely one. \n\nThe remaining of the videos are paraphrases from books, with a bunch of fundamental errors sprinkled in for taste. You're expected to remember all of that, including misinformation. \n\nThe mini projects (i. e. homework) are ill prepared. Unlicensed Windows, outdated software, non-working environment, etc. These issues were reported in earlier semesters but none bothered to fix them. The staffs just don't give a f*ck. And the previous sentence is my only review about the staffs. \n\nThe exams, as mentioned before, expect much rote-learning. But questions are badly written. In a true/false setting, most questions can go either way depending on the (missing) context. There is no way to reason them out, even security pros fail to match the answers. The final is especially terrible. Scheduled for ~3 hours, many completed in ~3 minutes. This class obviously does not meet any educational standard. \n\nTo recap, taking this class would set you back a few steps on your way to a good job. There are better security classes in the OMSCS program. But please do take this class if learning-by-rote is your kinda thing and you want to sell security to your boss. This class is easy and has enough spins for that.",

I tracked the time I spent on this class down to the minute, and spent an average of 9 hours a week watching lectures, doing assignments, or reading Piazza. This is definitely a class where you'll get out of it what you put into it. There are extra reading assignments that you can do (for fun), you can interact on Piazza about questions offered up in the videos, and Dr. Joyner really tries to facilitate student interaction on Piazza. Also, these videos were by far my favorite in the program (out of 10 classes taken). \n\nThe assignments were generally pretty straightforward writeups that were directly correlated with the lectures. We learned and went through the design lifecycle over the course of 5 assignments (1 assignment/week). While parts of this felt a little rushed due to the need to get outside participation in surveys or interviews in a week's span, the assignments themselves were light (~1000 words), yet informative. This class provided a glimpse into what it looks like to iterate through the design lifecycle with a focus on user-centered design, which I felt was informative and necessary for creating high quality solutions to problems. \n\nI would be slightly concerned about a lack of rigor during the fall or spring semesters, when students have 6 extra weeks to move through the material, but I guess there is plenty of room to perform needfinding to a fuller extent or create higher fidelity prototypes. Even so, I would assume this would be a relatively light class, and could pair well with a more time-intensive class.",

The professor runs the lectures of the course nearly directly from a technical book, with his preferences emphasized. It sometimes feels more like a survey of a wide range of industrial control topics with an emphasis on the power grid. The problem is that it's a poorly written book in both language and conceptual layout. For example, you find repetition of facts at the beginning, middle, and end - but all high level concepts without specifics. \n\nTechnical papers the professor wrote were more interesting than anything in the book, and I wish the professor focused more on his work instead of the book - \"Industrial Network Security\". There was a little bit of opinion/politics thrown into a couple lecture - and this is my ultimate pet peeve. \n\nNot too much detail on most topics or specific technical challenges like you will find in nearly every other OMSCS course. Two of the three projects allow for a slightly deeper dive, but still not what you would expect from your average GT graduate course. The instructor did post a few things throughout the semester on piazza, but TA involvement was puzzling. Although the TAs do answer random questions, you definitely get the feeling that the TAs have a lot better things to do than answer questions on piazza. Even with that our TAs still really seem like great people, and I liked them. \n\nThe hardest part of the course is having so few grading events. There are two tests and three projects. And the tests are not long, so you have to make each grade count. \n\nI write a review for every class I take, and this will be the first negative review for any class. That probably speaks to the strength of OMSCS. It's not a BAD class, per se, but it does not stand up to many of the others. And that's a pretty high bar.",

If you are looking for a class where you can have meaningful discussions and really dig into the material, definitely pass on this course for now. \n\nProfessor Lee never communicated with students a single time. When a project was shut down when students got emails from GA Tech Cyber Security telling them they were violating institute policy and potentially federal law, there was silence. When the final project was based around a paper he authored and questions were posted regarding both practical and theoretical application of the concepts, there was silence. The instructor could have been listed as \"Mickey Mouse\" and the student experience would have been the same. \n\nOther instructors were not much help either. If you have a question about something in a project writeup, be prepared to be told to re-read the writeup ad nauseum or to literally beg for clarification on Piazza and then get ignored. Expect cryptic or poorly-worded responses from instructors buried in random threads with no further clarifications provided, and private posts to go unresolved for entire project windows. One TA did hold weekly office hours and actively participated in Slack and Piazza, but it just wasn't enough. \n\nStudents were also limited in their ability to help each other, despite the lack of instructor participation. Trying to give hints or troubleshoot led to one occasion of instructors threatening students with honor code violations. Solutions to past projects were also deemed off-limits due to the fear of withdrawn students hiding on Piazza to learn the solutions.

So what's the point? I hate courses that function like a laundry list of concepts to memorize, but if they can't even write unambiguous exam questions based on that list, the course is garbage. (Additionally, the lectures are just a condensed version of the book readings, rendering the readings redundant and unnecessary. ) The projects were poorly explained and there was much reliance on the student Slack channel for project setup (hint: project setup is like 90% of the work for the projects). To top it all off, the instructor was either unengaged or condescending. The course is technically \"easy\" in terms of workload and subject matter, but I would imagine that most people got B's just due to there being few grading events that don't measure your understanding very well. I just finished the final in less than three minutes, having settled on an end goal of getting over half of the T/F questions correct for a B (the A being unattainable or not worth it due to crap questions).

            "text": "I would like to give this class a better rating because I really enjoyed the material and Dr. Thrun, and it fairly well organized in some ways. However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don't require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked. Definitely do a team for Project 3, and study extra early (read Probabalistic Robotics, and read on your own, don't rely on the lectures).",

I would like to see more applied assignments like project 2. \n\nA little too much material to cover in a summer semester.

The second half focuses on the design lifecycle. It gives you a process for designing and refining interfaces. It's a very practical approach that I think maps very well to industry. It reminds me a lot of Lean Startup and how to arrive at a great interface using qualitative and quantitative data, and minimizing risk and time. \n\nIf you've taken a course from Dr. Joyner before, you know that he turns out a quality product and works continuously to improve it. This course is well-run. The lectures are to-the-point. He also has lots of \"5 Tips for X\" videos that help boil down the content to practical, actionable steps. \n\nI found the grading somewhere between fair and generous. On your research projects, it's also ok to have ideas that don't work out, as long as you explore them properly. \n\nAll in all, a great course.",

Each assignment applies a specific portion of the class which allows for you to solidify the content in the lectures. \n\nThe main negative I have is that the summer class felt rushed, and there was this heightened level of stress throughout the semester as there was something new to do every week. There is no breathing room, which I suppose is common for a summer course. It is possible to front load things early on, which is a HUGE plus to me. \n\nNOTE: a review below says you have to fill out your own application to an IRB, that is not true. There is a class wide umbrella. You DO have to take an online class to understand what an IRB is, how it is applied, etc. That takes a couple of hours, and is MORE than just logistics.

The course was very challenging, but part of the challenge is tied into taking the course in the summer. With 6 homeworks, 3 projects and a final added on top of 20+ hours of lecture and 25+ papers to read, it's a lot of content for an 11 week (really, nothing much is available the first week, so 10-week) semester. \n\nThe TA group was top-notch - the best group of TA's I've encountered. \n\nThe projects were challenging, but fulfilling to get them done, similar to ML in that respect, but definitely a lot more hands-on. Also, you are expected to both write a short (3-page) paper and complete a short (5 minute) video presentation for each project. \n\nThe homeworks can be hit or miss. Of the 6, 3 were somewhat time consuming, and 1 of the 3 was extremely time consuming, however that may change in future semesters as they have been adjusting the HW to move towards a more auto-graded style. 5/6 were auto-graded and the one that was not was the extremely time consuming one. \n\nThe final exam is challenging, but fair, in it's current format. This is speculation, but given the expected 2 weeks to study in a normal semester, it would likely have felt a bit more manageable to review all of the content. \n\nOverall, I thought the course was worthwhile, but it is definitely not one to take lightly with regards to workload or effort required.",

At one point I really thought, if you know it then you got it else drop the class and that was the worst feeling ever. \n\nNote: I have seen TAs doing better and great job in order to help folks and in making understand assignments better in other courses e. g. CV (King Pedro rocks!!). \nFelt like Miguel, Tim and Chris were the only TAs who were proactively participating and other TAs were nothing more than project graders. \n\nI read somewhere in below comments that TAs were as busy as we were but I don't understand what made TAs busier than us as Hws were autograded and only thing that TAs were busy with Project grades (as well finals and HW5) and just one office hour per week (ignoring the 2-3 hands on session given by Miguel/Chris). Moreover, that was part of their job to support all these activities. \n\n6 TAs joining same Office hour per week, could not understand that thing. I think that was waste of time for most of them as mostly Miguel and Tim drove those oHs and they could have divided the hands on and query sessions among themselves and could have provided more value to the folks like me. \n\nIn the end, I am satisfied with what I learned from this course but if it were not for my peers, I would not have made it this far in this course. \n\nHappy Reinforcement Learning!!",

On occasion, there was an OK lecture, but by and large they were far too shallow to be useful. \n\n2. ) The projects were riddled with problems. Very often, issues with the projects would be figured out deep in the comments of Piazza and there would never be an update or an announcement to the class that the problem was found, so if you didn't read /everything/ in Piazza, you were probably running in circles. \n\n3. ) The professor delegated nearly everything to the TAs and the TAs were /terrible/\n\n4. ) Grading was cryptic and ridiculous. Forgot the \"www. \" on a URL even though you verified it wasn't in the packet? Doesn't matter, that's 1% of your final course grade. Got the solution working 90% of the way? Oh, that's a 0 because nowhere did it say it was all or nothing, which translates to 5% of your final course grade. TAs had to regrade nearly every project and it was like pulling teeth to get them to realize their mistakes. As well, they never released the answers, so we just have to trust them after all their fumbles. \n\n5. ) I learned nothing. I think the longest project took me 6 hours and the shortest about 2 hours and it would've been very easy to do each one without watching the lectures or reading the papers. \n\nThis class has great potential, but in its current form it's absolutely terrible.

This meant something was due every week, with projects due every 3 weeks. \n\nI'd say this course in the summer is at least as much work as ML in a full semester, if not more. I wish I had taken it in a full semester, as even doubled up with another class I think the slower pace for the projects would have been extremely helpful. \n\nRegarding the course overall, I liked it, but not as much as I was expecting to. The lectures were great, the volume of expected readings was overwhelming, and I have mixed feelings about the projects. I really enjoyed the second project (Lunar Lander), where we used cutting-edge RL techniques to solve an OpenAI Gym problem. The first and third projects were both replicating results from papers, and I found I don't enjoy that very much. I think it's a valuable skill to have, but the emphasis was too heavy on it. My ideal would be to keep the first project as a paper replication project, but replace the third project with one similar to the second (where we read papers to learn the techniques and apply them to solve a challenging problem). I actually quite enjoyed the material the third project focused on. \n\nI also didn't really see the point of submitting both a 3-page paper and a 5-minute recorded presentation (with an exception for project 2, where it was neat to be able to show videos of my agent playing Lunar Lander). I think this is a common complaint, as the TAs polled the class on our preferred submission format, so I think this might change going forward. \n\nOne last thing, Dr. Isbell was almost completely absent from Piazza (I knew from reviews here to expect this, but it's a big departure from ML). The TA team was exceptional and did a great job of running the course, especially Miguel and Tim, but I wish Dr. Isbell was more active.",

            "text": "I loved this class and wish more courses followed this format! It's an almost completely open-ended class where you propose a project and then work on it throughout the course. The professor and TAs are good about making sure you know the expectations for the class, that you keep your scope for you project reasonable, and that you are roughly on track throughout the course. If you prefer a more structured course, you may not enjoy this course, however if you like to work on a project that interests you personally and have a ton of creative control then you will enjoy this class. \n\nI would suggest having a rough idea of what you would like to do for the project going into the course. However if you aren't sure, educational technology is a pretty broad field and the first few weeks are spent researching various topics in the field to help you brainstorm ideas. \n\nAs far as grading and workload, the expectation is that the scope of the project itself will be about 100 hours. This amounts to 10-15 hours of work each week. You should be able to earn an 'A' if you put in the time and communicate your progress (even if you end up behind your original schedule). Difficulty is really how familiar you are with the work you do for the project, and since you choose what to work on you can control how much you want to branch out there. \n\nTaking this course over the Summer is tougher but do-able, you are looking at a few extra hours a week due to tighter timelines.",

I dont have much time, and I am actually taking these courses because I want to learn and grow - the TAs absolutely did not care if you learned or not. They did not care to teach, or even fix their own issues on their assignments. Many times, questions students had were usually responded with \"read the writeup again\" (that was NOT clear at ALL, hence the flood of questions) or even in one case \"do not ask questions or you will get a honor code violation\". \n\nI was not active on the slack channel, but I can assure you that the professor never commented once in Piazza. I just did a search to be sure, and NOTHING showed up. Just frustrating. \n\nTAs and Professor did not show any sort of enthusiasm or care at all as to the learning outcomes of this class. i would have learned more if i just read a few articles on wikipedia about security for 10 minutes than i had this entire course.",

Some are more. None are less. It's a lot, but not that bad compared to some other courses (looking at you AOS... ). They connect very well to the lectures. \n\n3 projects (15% each). 6 home works (5% each). 1 final (25%). \n\nIt's a ton of work for the summer. It's a grind with something due every week. Even if you're ahead you'll get behind with the projects. You should definitely take ML before this. If not, you're in for a party. Highly recommend folks getting familiar with Barto and Sutton's book (it's free on Sutton's website), David Silver's RL lectures (YouTube), and numpy (vectorization for the win). \n\nHW 1-4, Project 1-2, and the final are fair and very related to the content (project 2 is awesome). HW 5-6 and Project 3 need to be reworked. HWs 5-6 are relatively easy, but are 'eh. ' Project 3 is a massive step up in complexity with little resources available if you don't 'get it. ' They were such an adrenaline kill after how great project 2 was. It sounds like the TAs are going to review and revamp. \n\nIsbell was absent, which was not a surprise due to past reviews. He was on piazza day 1, and that's essentially it. He missed the one office hour he was going to attend due to a storm. \n\nTAs were able to get Michael Littman on a special office hours, which was awesome. Last semester they got Richard Sutton. Littman is a genius, and it was an awesome experience. \n\nOne note, after reading some negative reviews, Michael Littman is a professor at Brown. He doesn't have access to GA Tech systems (Piazza). Fine to down vote the course for Isbell not showing up, but it's ignorant to down vote for a Browns prof not being active at GA Tech. \n\nTAs are knowledgeable. They will answer your questions. They sometimes need to review specifics (if referencing a paper). You will not find a better group of TAs.",

The prof (MK) never showed up after the first week. Not once. This might be OK in another class, but it meant that we didn't get any of the open-ended, research-oriented interaction promised in the syllabus. It also meant that the TAs floundered. They kept saying, \"I emailed the prof and I'll let you know what I hear. \" On the rare occasion the TAs were able to reach the prof, she made more false promises about when she'd show up. Prof hung the TAs out to dry, along with the entire class. The TAs made effort for the first half of the course, but by the end, most Piazza questions about the material went unanswered -- even the ones asking for guidance on errors in the test prep materials. \n\nThe exams were multiple choice and T/F with lots of ambiguity. In higher education, there's often some ambiguity, and you write about it and address it. In a multiple-choice exam, however, there is no opportunity to address the ambiguity! The tests are written using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, and I never knew whether I was overthinking a sloppily-written question or if it was a trick question. Both types (sloppy and trick) are on the exam. I managed to do pretty well, but that was by careful deconstruction of the test author's psyche.

The TAs were poorly organized and communication was extremely limited - there were so many unanswered, critical questions on Piazza. \n\nThe professor for the summer didn't even show up once. We were waiting for announcements that never came. The TA's favorite saying was, \"I'm still waiting to hear back from the professor\". \n\nThe test grading was absolutely ridiculous - the final was 30% of your grade and it was filled with multiple choice questions where the possible credit per question was 0, 0, 20, 60, or 100%. (5 multiple choice options, and any incorrect selections subtracted from your credit. This was true whether it was supposed to un/checked although the claimed purpose was to \"prevent people from clicking every option\" so not checking a box that was supposed to be checked still gets you marked off, which was stupid). So if you got 4/5 choices correct, you got 60% credit. 3/5 got you 20% credit. So stupid. \n\nThere are a TON of papers to read that have no relationship to the course except that the exams ask questions specific questions about them. \n\nI feel like too many people before said, \"This class is easy!\" so the professors/TAs decided to make things stupidly hard. I got an A on the final because I studied my ass off. I don't understand the need for rote memorization on things that don't matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course. \n\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews about the class being unorganized and I thought, \"Oh, they've got it figured out by now. \" No. They don't. Don't take this class.",

The assignments were painful in terms of having to work through incorrect or ambiguous instructions. In some projects then there would be a comment in Piazza that clarified something or corrected an error but that would be late into the project and in some cases meant repeating the project. It also meant that you had to spend a lot of time on Piazza, not just reading every post once but going back to see if an instructor had added a comment at a later date. I spent a lot of time re-working the projects which I feel was time wasted. For one of the projects it is still ambiguous as to why we had to do something a particular way and it has not been explained despite several attempts at asking. \n\nIn addition one project involving zmap Internet scanning resulted in many students being flagged by the IT department as performing unauthorized Internet scanning. This is something that should have been cleared with them in advance by the professor. It left students unable to complete the assignment, although they were given an alternative quiz afterwards it was very poorly handled. \n\nIn summary it is an interesting course and I did learn a lot from it, but the projects were very poorly handled in terms of incorrect instructions and ambiguities.",

The course material itself is interesting - If you don't know in detail how internet works and nothing about traffic engineering, security issues, what is a cluster etc this is a good course to learn. It assumes you know undergrad networking knowledge (which i do not have) so there is a bit of learning curve\n\n2. Second project is difficult - You need to know algorithm for this. I did not know and got 60/130\n\n3. Lectures - My goodness this is the most difficult part. Content isn't bad but delivery needs improving\n\n4. TAs- My class TAs were amazing. held the courses together and responded fast and with respect. Kudos to Kelly Parks (head TA) and other TAs with her. \n\n5. Professor - Promised discussions for extra credit but didn't deliver. Gave 5% boost to everyone at the end but you could have just said you were going to do that from the beginning. Not sure why you had to make everyone anxious until the last week of the class\n\n6. Exams - Only multiple choice. Not sure why it was formatted like this. It was helpful to get your grades fast but I would have appreciated bit more free form answer discussion. I guess the classes were too big? not sure\n\nOverall not a bad course if you want to learn about networking. I do wonder what the opportunity cost is though. You should think about whether you REALLY want to learn networking or not. If you think this is a blow off class like it used to be, it's not. Prepare to put in 10-15 hours of work",

Tighter scripting would be helpful. (Many others, though, love the style. )\n--The oral presentations for the projects seem pointless. I never received any feedback on them, and they seemed to have no impact on my grades. \n--At least for the summer, there is a short window (less than a week) after finishing the last project to study for the final, which covers the whole semester. \n--Feedback isn't very detailed, and the specific point deductions for the projects and final exam are not revealed. \n--Just keeping up with the homework and projects can leave little time for reading the assigned papers",

The class is run by the TAs, most of them very engaged with the assignments on Piazza and Slack. The content is interesting and timely, we were studying malware by the time wannaCry was released!, The assignments are not complex but some will challenge you and will ask you to think​ in more creative ways to achieve results. As constructive feedback, this class needs a better video format, it's basically the professor reading the slides, and make the auto-graders a little smart, you get a lot of deductions that will weight in your final grade, because of trivial problems like file names and spelling.",

            "text": "I'm pretty much echoing the other comments. This course is different than the typical OMSCS course (It was my 7th one, for basis of comparison). It is unstructured in the sense that there are not formal video lectures throughout [there are several introductory videos from Dr. Joyner on Udacity you'll watch in the first week, but that's it and even those are informal]. The rest of the course involves researching educational technology and proposing a project which you'll then complete while working with an assigned mentor. However, it is structured in the sense that you'll be guided through a series of objectives and milestones along the way. Discussion on Piazza plays a big part too... basically every day, there'll be some suggested topic to discuss or debate, although everyone is encouraged to ask questions, share articles or other interesting content they've found and just generally join in much as you would in a traditional seminar course. The TAs and Professor were extremely responsive and involved, but they also managed to stay out of the way and avoid micromanaging. The style of individual mentors varies as you'd expect but they make an attempt to match you up for a good fit and I had no problems working with mine. Finally, peer reviews are also included.... my impression of the utility of those was mixed. In all cases, various sorts of 'participation' are acknowledged and form part of your final grade. At the beginning, you'll probably wonder \"What have I go myself into ?\" but before long you'll find yourself fitting into the flow just fine. Your communication skills will definitely be exercised... there are weekly essays prior to actually beginning the project phase, milestone & progress reports, a final project video presentation, and a final project paper suitable for publication. Time management is also important, particularly in the compressed summer semester. Bottom line --- you'll get out of it what you put into it.",

Having a basic understanding of python, network\\programming basics, and android development. \n\nMy expectations for the class were to lean about network security and ways to prevent attacks or make it harder for attacks to happen. After the course I would say some of these expectations were met. \n\nThe course feels like a great overview of some of the security vulnerabilities in the existing structure of networks and the internet. It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them. \n\nThe course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted. \n\nOverall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors. \n\nThe Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class. He did not even post a single comment and was not involved in the class at all. \n\nThe TAs lead this class completely, with one TA standing way above all the rest. And he wasn’t even the head TA.",

Professor highly involved along with TAs. Highly recommended. Assignments released on Friday, due Friday (7 days). Makes a good, getting back into academics, course. \n\nPrep: Have good familiarity java and android development; have the ability and time commitments to work with a team to get a group project done. \n\nMy expectations of this class were to refresh some of the basics that I already knew from coding in industry for 7+ years. The class met these expectations, but relied on some outdated information and documentation that is not actually used in the real world industry. \n\nThe course was a great overview of what it takes to develop software from the systems or business side of things. Not just the guts of programming. The course takes you through the steps from initial concept, requirements gathering, documenting designs for approvals, prototyping, reviewing designs again, implementation, testing, and final presentation\\shipment for a software project. \n\nThe class leans more towards requirement gathering and documentation then programming, so be prepared for that. \n\nThe course had almost no flaws in it, besides the team picking process and getting the students to work together, but that is a separate issue. The TAs and professor were very helpful and willing to see the students learn the material. \n\nAs others have mentioned, while this is a decent course for those who are not good programmers, you still need to be able to program to take this course. This is a Computer Science Masters degree after all. This course also has little learning for industry experienced developers, but it worked as a decent transition back into academia after being out of it for a while.",

I probably watched 30% of the lectures but read all of the course slides and that turned out to be enough. The quizzes provided in the lectures are the worst I've ever seen. Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don't evaluate what you've learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don't pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project's specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn't do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As. The lesson here is just do the work and start early on the projects. They are not extremely difficult but they do take time so don't underestimate them.

The XYZ_test. py files they provide weren't perfect - let's put it this way. \nTAs are trying their best to be helpful with their delightful sense of humor. In most cases I waited for 24-48 hours before a TA addresses a question I posted on Piazza. There were complaints about absence of TAs, so I'd suggest them hold daily mentoring sessions instead of just 3 times a week for summer terms (perhaps less frequent for spring/fall since it's less intense). People got frustrated by unclear expressions in the assignments and exams. \nUnlike other courses I've taken, the instructor was almost absent on Slack or Piazza. I have no idea why - probably he was on summer vacation and handed everything to TAs...",

However they give you no training in creating a UI. If you don't have people on your team who have done this sort of thing before you are in for trouble. In the demo that you are required to give at the end of the phase there is no proper rubric as to what and how you are required to demonstrate. No complete guidelines. They give you something called a demo guidelines for phase 3. Even if you have it all working according to those guidelines you will have points deducted because some column is not sorted by date by default. I think the project should only test you on what is taught in the class. Not on how well you create a UI that interacts with your database. That is completely outside the scope of what is taught. This is the part that makes it hard. Otherwise the instructor was quick to respond to many things in piazza. The main TA Will regularly took part in office hours. The other TAs are invisible.",

If you got the projects done during the first week, the second week was mostly just lectures/reading. \n\nThere is a ton of reading in this class. It can get a bit dry and daunting, especially since each week there are a handful of papers to read, each being ~13-15 pages in length. On top of that, some projects have a surprise paper that must be read to complete it. On top of this, even though some papers are split into the second week of the project, they are helpful to read if completing the project during the first week. This also applies to the video lectures. \n\nFor the summer semester, there were 5 projects and 2 tests. Project 1-3 were pretty simple, Project 2 taking the most time. Projects 4-5 were a bit more open ended and validating your work could sometimes be difficult. \n\nBecause it was the summer, they squished the latter half of the content into a single exam worth 30% of your grade. In my opinion, this was too heavily weighted, with each incorrect answer reducing your final grade by over 1% (as there were only 26 questions on this exam. )\n\nThe TAs were responsive and helpful, but the instructor was completely absent. She appeared once to ask \"why we were interested in the course. \" She was supposed to post weekly discussion threads to provoke thoughtful discussion, but this never happened. These discussion threads were to apply to a 5% extra credit score, which ended up being applied to everyone's grade since no threads were ever posted. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and I learned a lot, but it has flaws which I hope are resolved in the coming semesters.",

You're working in teams, though, and despite their pleas to the contrary, that means you're practically only going to get hands-on experience with some of this. \n\nThe exams, are - to me - a bummer. They account for 50% of the total grade. They are 25 questions each, which means your margin for error is slim. And aggravatingly, each contained one or two trick questions that were intended to catch you on some technicality or wording instead of testing your knowledge. I spent probably 20-25 hours studying for each and did not do well on one of them. I've been using SQL databases in my job for nearly 20 years, so this was a pretty befuddling result. \n\nIn all, I think the class is in the lower half of the pack for OMSCS.

Best part was each of those important papers were precisely explained in Udacity videos except Professor's dialect :) I listened to the videos and read the papers. Quizzes require reading. Projects were really awesome. I did all the projects very well. I was able to relate the practical aspect of the Network Security via projects. One project was really challenging one. I had to scan the whole world wide Internet using university supported infrastructure and processes. The last project was really cool. I had to read the research paper and implement the python code to evade the Intrusion detection itself. I also got good reading material for Bit coins. On down side, auto grading kept me in tension till l last minute.. Also, many fellow students were appeared to be super smart. They were also very helpful. I needed to be on Piazza & Slack up to date. At the end, I realized, Security was really mindset. Overall, TAs helped me to complete the course successfully.

Might be just me, but I felt like the test were trickier, basically not doing as well on the test as I thought I did when I took the test. Make sure you know C or have done some C programming before you take this class, there are MANY people who drop out during the first project just for this reason of thinking they will learn on the fly and are not able to keep up. From the perspective of someone with a undergrad CS degree (obviously this will vary based on your undergrad CS program rigor) everything up to about a little after mid term I already had familiarity with or forgot (Obviously the class went in greater depth of the topics I already covered in undergrad so I learn't new stuff here and there in the first half of the content). On the second part of the semester is where It covers virtualization and distributed systems, RPC and was where I really saw new content for me personally. If I took this during the longer semester I probably would have rated this class a medium difficultly based on my background. \n\nLike I said prior, unless you are pretty good in C, the projects will consume A LOT of your time and the test seemed tricky or maybe for the summer I was just a bad test taker..

I'm fighting to get the grades uploaded, and they've been out for about 5 minutes, and you can't wait for me to finish before you start asking questions?\" That sort of emotional outburst and unprofessional behavior was common. People quickly stopped using Piazza for most questions, to avoid exposing themselves to that sort of thing. \n\nThis course was poorly-planned, poorly run, poorly organized, and had a significant focus on irrelevant material (thank goodness someone on our team knew PHP, that old mainstay of database design).

Essentially, there's the 6-week Udacity portion (which is great), then with no further instruction there are two more projects (which are beyond the scope of the lectures - although they'll tell you otherwise). Of course, you can solve the last two projects with just the knowledge gained from the lectures, but it's very difficult to do so. You'll have to do more unguided research than you expect. Despite reviews from past semesters rating this course as an easy one, I urge you not to expect this course to be easy, because it's not (unless you're already familiar with the math and robotics). \n\nMy advice: if you need this class for your specialization (like me) then you'll just have to go for it, however if you don't need it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, at least not during a short summer semester. Hopefully in the near future (like ASAP) they'll fix this course. \n\nTo end on a more positive note, if you don't take this course, I highly recommended doing the Udacity portion on your own.

I am also an amateur photographer and very comfortable with a DSLR camera. This course comes with a weekly assignment which is to be turned in every Monday leaving very little breathing space. As this was my first course, i had signed up for only one course and was able to spend atleast a day or two for the A&B (Above and Beyond) section. For many assignments (7-8 of them), lot of time is spent on research and report writing. The TAs shared some of the exemplary reports for each assignment and it was ridiculously amazing at the amount of work being put into them :)\n\nThe first 2-3 assignments are pretty simple and straight forward, though few of them requires setting up equipment (Camera Obscura), taking loads of pictures (Photos of space, feature matching) and few assignments have specific coding requirements (HDR). We get two weeks for the final project and the final exam is an open book multi choice test. \n\nOne of the best parts of this course is the auto grader for the coding parts of the assignment with Instant feedback and unlimited submissions. \n\nFrom discussions over slack, few had paired this course with another course based on the earlier reviews and faced difficulties due to the assignment schedule. \n\nCheck the Course Google group for insight into what kind of assignments were worked upon.

I think this course could serve as a good introduction to C as well as operating system fundamentals, and it's not that hard to get an A despite not having experience with C. \nMy background - technical undergraduate degree (non-CS, a little programming), web developer for 3 years using higher-level languages, and read 'The C Programming Language' as I was starting the course. \nExperience with the course - this course requires a decent time commitment, both for projects and for keeping up with lectures. Most weeks had 3-4 hours of video for lectures, and I worked steadily on projects every week, making sure I kept up with recommended benchmarks so I didn't fall behind. Not being familiar with C meant that I did a decent amount of googling for basics (and referring back to my book), and I also requested help [moderately] often from the slack channel. However, most of my problems were not strictly due to lack of language familiarity (the homeworks do not demand anything that complicated in terms of C) - more often I was confused about the concepts or made silly mistakes due to lack of confidence. The TA's are extremely helpful and responsive, and other students were helpful too. I believe there was also an introduction to C office hour held at the beginning of the course (but I did not attend).",

The second project hadn't been assigned as mandatory before and it was not really ready to be released. There were a lot of issues with the descriptions and grading of that project. Hopefully it will be smoother in future semesters. The final project seemed impossible at first, but if you just experiment with things you have learned in this class (or other classes) you will find you can achieve decent results. So my two pieces of advice for the final project:\n1) Write a good script to test with. This will really help with #2\n2) Experiment with different approaches. Just try things. Overall I implemented 5 approaches and fine-tuned the best of those five. \n\nLectures: Not many lectures, only 6 but they were of good educational quality though some of the in lecture quizzes had a bit of disconnect from the instructions given in the \"intro\" video for the quiz. \n\nHomework: You have a homework set for each Lecture. The answers are given during the lecture so you should be able to get a perfect score here. (30% of your grade)\n\nProjects: As noted above the first was pretty straightforward. The second was pretty hard and a bit of a mess for our semester at least. The final project can be done in groups if you want, that might help with my advice above about trying different approaches. I went solo and got a good score.

The assignments took me like 20-30 hours each (spread through 2 weeks, a workload of 15 hours/week). \n\nOn the other hand I can see how for someone with no experience AT ALL in the skills mentioned above, this class could take as much as 30-40 hours/week. \n\nSome people have mentioned \"you HAVE to LEARN Pig/Hbase/Hive\". I don't think that's exactly the case. I found myself googling things like \"how to left join pig\" and adapting some snippet from S. O. On the other hand if you don't really know what an outer join, group by, etc. are, of course it will be hard to look for something you don't understand. \n\nCompleting the labs before the class started helped me a lot: http://www. sunlab. org/teaching/cse6250/spring2017/lab \nIn that way, I didn't waste time setting up the environment for each assignment (the labs are closely related with assignments 2, 3, and 4). \n\nAs other reviews as mentioned, you are mostly on your own on the 2nd part of the class, but I think the grading was very lenient.

Grading is very fair although one of my complaints in a lot of these lower level classes is that roughly 50% of the class gets 100% on assignments and then there is a steep drop off. You either aced the testing criteria the TA / Professor had in place or you lose 10, 15, 30%. I would rather see an actual bell curve where very few students get 100% even if the majority get 90+. \n\nBesides the group project, all of the programming required is on par with sophomore level programming classes especially if you have any Java experience. For the other assignments such as defining test cases, diagrams, etc. I only found about 20-30% of it actually value added but I appreciate being exposed to these various tools even if at the end of the day I didn't find many of them useful in the real world. \n\nFor the group project, as many others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your teammates. That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by assigning tasks based on individual skills, don't try to break it up \"evenly\" or \"fairly\". If one member of your team writes android applications professionally there is nothing wrong with having that person write the entire app themselves. Another person do all of the diagrams, and another all of the writeup. Run your team like you would an interdisciplinary team at work. \n\nI gave 3 stars as I personally didn't learn much in this class, if you come in to OMSCS with a lot of coding experience its ok to skip this one and take something more challenging or interesting.",

You spend the first few weeks figuring out which areas you're interested in, and the remainder of the semester is spent putting your project together. Those first few weeks are very important as they will change the complexion of your experience in the course depending on what you choose. I worked on a team, and I think that is the best way to approach this class. You have other students that are holding you accountable and that are dependent upon you to get a good grade. You can do the project individually if you'd like (most people did, but I wanted a bigger project). It is also worth noting that you have one TA in this course - your mentor. So if you have any questions or want to know what to do to succeed, you have one person you can ask. In my opinion, this made it much easier because you're not getting conflicting information or trying to juggle multiple people's expectations. It is also much easier to get answers to your questions because one TA isn't trying to answer all of the questions - just their group of students' questions.",

This process is incredibly helpful as it presents things that you do in the real world. \n\nWhat I didn't like was the weight put on sticking to OOP principles throughout the process. While the instructors have to pick some sort of way of evaluating code, picking specific programming paradigms/features cause problems as it is outside the stated goals of project architecture/documentation/design/implementation. That said, if you have any sort of OOP background you should be OK in this course (another important piece of info is this course is very much a \"do your assignments in Java\" course). \n\nI got the feeling that this course is somewhat evolving and some of the lecture material isn't useful for the full implementation of the projects.

Very little participation by Prof Isbell, but the TAs were incredibly enthusiastic, involved, and had considerable knowledge of the subject. \n\nThe videos are well done. They're a bit chatty though as I learned going back through them for the final trying to take notes. I liked the blend of theoretical and practical, but if math isn't your think, the theoretical part is pretty dense. \n\nThe workload is quite high in the summer. After the first week, there's a homework (6 of them), project (3), or test (the final) due every Monday. I. e., [hw, hw, project]*3 + final. There are probably 20+ hours of lectures and 20+ papers. I don't think anyone really read all the papers in depth and most fell behind on the videos. We were always struggling to keep up with graded assignments. The second project (lunar lander) also required reading unassigned material (almost everyone who was successful used DQN, which wasn't explicitly covered). You should aim to get the two homeworks done in a week and leave yourself two weeks for the project, if you're taking it in the summer. The extra weeks in a regular semester would make a very big difference in the pace. You could do one hw per week and have two weeks for the project. \n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to see the course a little less project-oriented and split the final into a mid-term plus a final. That would force folks to stay up with the material and keep it up from being a semester of projects followed by a week of cramming. You could remove a project or make them a little easier. For instance, I would provide the soccer environment for project 3 and maybe give hints on some hyperparameters for the lunar lander project -- aspects of the projects that don't really have pedagogical value. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot and feel like you accomplished something.",

This class provided a good introduction to machine learning while still making the projects challenging enough for someone in my position to appreciate. \n\nMy biggest complaint with this class has to do with the fact that I took it over the summer. I would highly recommend that you take this class during a full-length semester if possible. I wanted to spend more time appreciating the concepts I was learning/implementing... but because of the fast pace of the summer, was unable to do so.

There are several projects (all coding, some include reports), two exams (finally is not cumulative), lots of lectures (with quizzes), and a participation grade that usually came in the form of a survey sent to your email. \n\nYou'll need extensive knowledge of Python for this class.",

I will admit that I learned a good bit in this course about a wide variety of different topics. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to teach most of this to myself. This, in my mind, made the course very stressful because the skills needed to complete the projects were not taught in the course. There was a lot of \"here's the manual, here's a paper, learn this new technology, complete the project. \" Some of the project write-ups were downright terrible and did not include nearly enough information for someone inexperienced with that particular system to complete it on their own, certainly not within the given time frame. Thank goodness for Piazza. Wouldn't have been able to finish the class without it. \n\nAnother thing which really bugged me: each project had a separate VM, and NONE of them were ready to go out of the box. Each required re-configuring, setup, or installations which were time consuming and error prone. On more than one project I spent more time setting up the environment than I did completing actual work. \n\nFinal thoughts: don't take this in the summer, and brush up on Linux, Virtual Box, port scanning, Snort, and JavaScript first. Go in with the expectation that this is a self-taught course, and expect to spend a LOT of time on Piazza. Start projects as soon as they become available and set aside plenty of time to work on them each day.",

Failed to impart any real understanding beyond the pre-packaged video content due to fear of releasing any real help (or content for future sessions) by openly discussing the problem both before or after the fact. Missed learning opportunity. \n\nAgain, the TA being overtly secretive about revealing approaches (not their fault) to the solutions produced the wrong kind of struggle for students. (Vastly different from ML4T, CP or CV--where you're guided to spend time focused on the right problems. ) And prevented forming a deep understanding of the mechanics of the concepts presented. Instead, this lead to time-wasting, misplaced effort and lots of wheel-spinning. The second downside was that once the project was completed, there were no real discussions about how each student approached and solved the problems—hence you’re left with whatever understanding you had without any affirmation or new insight as to the different approaches taken. \n\nThe lead instructor (not Thrun) was barely involved and didn’t seem to be in touch with the class other than to chastise the class for possible violation of the honor code. To be fair, the generous curve at the end provided some relief but overall, it was pretty stressful (in the wrong way).",

But then Dr. Starner was on sabbatical at Google all summer (working on Google Glass). So, our head instructor was one of Dr. Starner's Ph. D. students, and he hadn't been involved with an OMSCS course before. That led to some issues that I'd never experienced or heard of in other OMSCS courses. \n \nThe good news is that I learned a lot. The R&N textbook is good. There were 6 fun and instructive programming projects. Each had an autograder with a submission cap (e. g., 1/hr or 20 total). I averaged 20 hr/project and got to 100 on 5 of the 6 projects. On project 3 (Bayes Networks), I only got to 85 after 37 hours and 20 submissions. Thankfully, we got to drop our lowest project grade. \n \nThe videos were from three different people and had dramatically different quality. Thad Starner's videos were great - professional and easy to follow. Peter Norvig's videos were ok - made with home video but with good explanations. Sebastian Thrun's videos were terrible - made with home video and with awful explanations. Thrun's videos covered some of the hardest topics (e. g., Bayes Networks), so they were a big disappointment. \n \nThe midterm and final exams were take-home, and they were good learning tools. They made me dig into several areas deeper. Each exam required a lot of TA clarifications on Piazza, but the TAs graded the tests fairly trying to take all the clarifications into account. The TAs were cool about regrade requests too if you could justify why you needed one. \n \nI averaged 22 hours per week and had an A before the curve. My only prior Python use was in the CN course (CS 6250), so I didn't know Numpy. This course takes hard work, but I strongly recommend that you only take it during a full semester when Dr. Starner is available to manage the course. I finished less interested in AI & ML than when I started.",

You write a lot of docs, code the project, then backfill your docs with what really happened. You create one really useful diagram that makes you think, and a ton of expository writing that just fills pages. So, a lot like any highly regulated domain. This presumably forms the core of the class. \n\nHowever, in summer, you get the thrill of concurrent group and individual assignments. The individual assignments contain a lot of \"aha!\" moments that can take hours or days to find. But you don't have hours or days - you spent those on Android. I bet these individual assignments carry meaning in a longer term. In summer, they stand in the way. The course lectures don't have the information or the presentation quality to pull off \"aha\" assignments. Most of what you need, you find googling. And you don't share what you find because you never know how close you walk the line of distributing unfair information. \n\nI would have felt much happier ignoring the lectures and spending that time on the individual assignments. Really, they do not help. \n\nLast point (completely serious): The instructors do not believe in the western tradition of starting things on Monday. They live in an alternate calendar. Get ready to fight it out with your bosses and spouses. This course has no respect for your school/work/life balance, and throws many obstacles in your way. Much harder courses strike the balance, why can't this?",

Before taking this class I had no real exposure to ML and now I'll probably wind up taking the official ML class. \n\nGrading feedback could have been a lot better / faster.

The optional textbook helps with that for this course. \n\nRequired for the summer were problem sets on Udacity (30%), project 1 (20%), project 2 (20%), final project (30%). There were numerous extra credit opportunities, both actual EC and pseudo EC that would push you to a higher grade if you were on the boundary. \n\nUdacity has all the answers for the problem sets and it was expected that we would use them before submitting. That's 30% of our grade just given to us. \n\nProject 1 was the runaway robot project on Udacity. Although it appears at the end of the Udacity course, only the first 3 lessons were relevant. Part 5 of the project ended up being extra credit. The first 4 parts are doable with basic math and probability, but the point is to use what was learned in those first 3 lessons. \n\nProject 2 involved helping a robot find its way around a warehouse. Contrary to what others say, the 3 parts of this project directly correspond to lessons 4, 5, and 6. Part A was a breeze. Part B was not but some really awesome students shared their own test cases on Piazza. Instructors used some when grading. They helped me find serious flaws in my code and my project 2 grade was better because of it. Thank you, awesome students. Anyone who didn't use those test cases only has themselves to blame. Part C had so many kinks it ended up becoming EC. Part B was regraded when it was discovered some test cases didn't match the project specs. \n\nFinal project, hexbug location prediction, sounds irrelevant to the material covered in class. It's not. It's certainly doable with irrelevant items but many successful projects used techniques (or extensions) from class. Using extensions of techniques learned in class is reasonable for a grad-level course in a top-tier school. \n\nTAs were great and helpful. Pryby as well, more so than others here suggest.",

I thought this course was not hard even though it was offered in the summer for the first time. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are not difficult to comprehend. I found the readings easy to understand due to how the amazing job the writers did. I made an effort to read all suggested chapters after watching the lectures. This will definitely help you to succeed in both the assignments and the exam. \n\nAssignments: Start early studying the requirements for these. Identify which part of the material you will need to solve them. However, don't start coding right away, the instructors were still making some modifications after the release date. Always prioritize coding efficiently. All assignments can be completed with runtimes less than 30 seconds. This will help you perform tests and modify your code faster. If your code is taking longer than that go back and try to find where it can be improved. \n\nExams: There were a midterm and a final both take home exams. Make sure you are caught up with the material (or at least most of it) before taking them. The questions are not hard and instructors were always there to clarify any possible ambiguity. They were also lenient with some questions when several students had a different interpretation of the problem statements. NOTE: Submit your pdf with what you did to get to the answer. They will give you partial credit if you got the answer wrong but your thought process was correct. \n\nStaff: In my opinion, the TAs did great. In spite of being the first summer offer, they handled the challenge well and were able to solve most issues. There were some problems with the final grading but my impression is that they eventually got resolved. \n\nI managed to get a 96% before the curve. They use the median to determine your letter grade: A = if you are above min(90%, median(final grades)).",

The professor has only made 3 very minor appearances on Piazza, only one TA is active, and the lectures are short and have almost nothing to do with the course content. Everything that I've learned has been through self-learning, which 1) is not a very efficient way to learn a large amount of new material as I find myself constantly reinventing the wheel and 2) I can do this for free on my own time, focusing on exactly what I'm interested in. The assignments do force you to learn new technologies and techniques, but I'm sure that I could have learned a lot more in a lot less time if there was guidance. \n\nI don't have a specific interest in data science, but in general I can't imagine myself liking any course where there's no meaningful instruction and instead we're given time-consuming (40+ hour) homeworks to hack away at using whatever resources we can find. The amount of work required for the amount I was learning was too great and in all likelihood none of this will ever be useful to me professionally so I cut my losses and dropped. If you actually work in this area or want to work in this area, the course might be worth it since it forces you to use a lot of different technologies, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nYou'll learn a lot in this class like the other reviews state, but it's because you'll spend almost as much time on it as you do at your full time job, not because it's actually a good class.

Unfortunately, there wasn't much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don't have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it. \n\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\n 1. Be careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things *very* awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\n 2. Check your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are *not* very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this. If something isn't compatible with the auto-grader, or there was a simple typo in a commit hash, function name, etc., then expect to receive zero points for that portion of the assignment, with no real wiggle room!",

            "text": "Until theres a restructure, I would avoid this course. Unfortunately, its a poor reflection of the OMSCS program and hopefully the feedback on OMSCentral will be used to improve the course.\n\nThere is almost no interaction between the instructors/TA and students on Piazza -- it was the least amount of Piazza/Slack activity I've observed so far in this program. There's pretty much nothing due for the first 4 weeks, then there's an extremely simple project that is made difficult through lack of clarity. After that, there's nothing due for a few more weeks until the Midterm that contains less than 20 multiple choice questions and is worth 25% of your grade. There is no direction on what to study, because the assessments are meant test the student's broad understand. This has the side effect of questions that are vague and open for interpretation, allowing multiple technically correct answers to some questions based on the level of abstraction of your interpretation. The books are just a really general overview of the topic. This course takes only a few hours of work per week to complete in its current state, and when the appropriate amount of effort is put forth, it will give you a 50% chance at a B, and 50% chance at an A. \n\nThe instructor is likable and he does a good job with the lectures, so that is one benefit. The instructor is knowledgeable in his field, just as you'd expect from a GA Tech professor.\n\nThis review isnt in retaliation for a bad grade, or a personal attack on any of the instructors; I received an A, and the instructors were willing to help a student when contacted. My theory is that outside of the lectures, the course was developed and operated by TAs from the brick and mortar program who just don't have much stake in the online program. I'd love to see this course improved upon.",

This may be one of the better \"easy\" electives to take in the OMSCS program, but it's definitely not one of the best courses in the program. \n\nThe lectures are shallow, fast paced, incomplete, and often a waste of time. The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It's nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren't covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is. \n\nThe projects are annoying. Often times there's a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile. The projects themselves often require spending a ton of time learning about very specific things to \"hack together\" the end result the instructors are looking for. The projects and lectures don't work together in any way; the projects require lots of learning of topics that are never taught by the instructors. Several of the projects were also very specific and not really accurate to real world situations. \n\nThis class is a shotgun scattershot of topics with poor instruction. The professor isn't engaged at all. The projects aren't hard, just frustrating and annoyingly time consuming for trivial things. If you'd really like to understand netsec, take 6035 and read Hackers' Playbook, Web App Hackers' Handbook, and Hacking: Art of Exploitation. Don't pay tuition for this course.",

This is a very hard class. If you are like me and 1) were not good in math theory and 2) have not done this sort of thing since college, then this will probably be really hard. I would recommend doing all the homework problems, and all the problems related to the material in the text book. When you are done with those, find another text book and do all the problems there. Practice is the only way you are going to pass, unless you are just really good at this sort of thing.\n\nThere is a project but it isn't worth too much, though it took me a long time to complete. The homework problems are more or less meaningless for your grade, but very important if you want to learn the material. The exams are all closed book. You get partial credit, but that means you made smaller mistake, and you still lose a very large portion, so you really need to know the material. To be fair to Dr. Vigoda, he tells you what he expects you to know to pass, and he holds you to that. Grading is very quick on exams for the amount of students and the content in them. Office hours are very good too, and I had to watch almost all of them to get at least some grasp of the materials.\n\nI would recommend taking this class early, but not before you get some study habits down. It took me 15 PTO days, and studying almost every night to get down most of this material. If I took this when I first started OMSCS (I have 24 credits as it stands) then I would have not been able to adjust to the workload and the amount of effort needed to pass. Also, it is probably going to suck. Many students did not do well on one or more exams (myself included), and though you will see the stereotypical \"look at how smart I am!\" tech students in piazza, remember that others are struggling as much as you are. Don't drop too early, so that you at least get some of the material down, and plow through it. ",

While there are mostly no formal proofs involved (although you will have to give informal proofs), there is still a ton of material and concepts. The math isn't terrible, and everything you forgot is re-hashed by Dr. Vigoda so you can get back up to speed (although for graphs you will want to do a refresher on your own; otherwise this isnt needed). \n\nTo prep: I suggest going to the course website https://8803ga. wordpress. com/ and watching at least the first 2/3 of the lectures (the professor links to the videos on this page). I'd particularly suggest, at a minimum, getting re-acquainted with asymptotic notation and the basics of graphs (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and basic graph terms are either lightly covered or not covered, depending, but you will need to know them),  \n\nThe class is do-able, but be willing to prep OR be willing to spend 40 hour weeks on the course. If you are already comfortable with asymptotic notation and graph theory, Dynamic Programming (DP) and NP-Complete (NP) will take you the most amount of time, so if you have a good handle on those going in it will make life far easier. I would suggest being able to at least hold a light conversation in all of these topics; with no exposure to these, 80-100 hours spent on them before the class will surely pay off. ",

Half of the class consists of short assignments, quizzes, and three essays which all have a hard word limit of 800 words, so you can't really go into depth for any of them. I felt like I didn't learn much through writing them because of this--I just scratched the surface of the topics. The only assignments that I feel like I benefitted from were a series of FHIR activities where we had to work with Java and perform various tasks with a FHIR database. It was a good crash corse in actually using FHIR. You could probably learn more from this course if you spend more time and did all the optional readings, but you could learn just as much independently, using google to find articles and information. I got 100% on everything so far, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't. \n\nThe second half of the class is a group project. You form groups or 4-6 and then can choose projects from a list provided. You rank your choices in order of preference and then you get what you get. You *are* allowed to think up your own project, but it is discouraged. Our group got one of our last choices, and it wasn't one I was even interested in, which made it very difficult to dedicate a lot of time to it. The project also ended up being quite different than we originally thought. You work with external \"mentors\" from various places like medical institutions, the CDC, etc, on the project. Many of the mentors are busy and don't have as much time to dedicate to the project as your group may need, so it can be difficult to get feedback from them or schedule phone calls. The group project also requires weekly status reports and quite a few powerpoint presentations, which took time to put together. I felt like this time could have been better used actually working on the project. Your grade is basically determined by how you do on the project, which highly depends on which project you end up with.",

Very responsive and understanding, and he always seems to be trying to improve the class. The lectures were expertly done and mostly enjoyable, and the content is useful and interesting. \n\nHowever, for some reason I just did not enjoy the class overall. I believe the main reason was the assignments. I had to force myself to do almost every one because I always felt like the assignments did not improve my understanding of the topics from the lectures - they were just \"busy work\" to me. I gained a good understanding of the course material after watching the lectures but I found myself spending hours trying to brainstorm ideas to apply that material to the essay-style questions that make up the assignments. In other words, I spent more time trying to come up with interfaces to write about than time learning the material. My feelings towards this might stem from the fact that I am a coder at heart and there were not any assignments that leveraged that. \n\nIn summary, if you don't mind doing a lot of brainstorming about different interfaces and writing about redesigns for them, then this class is great. If you decide to skip out on this course, at least bookmark the lectures and watch them in your free time - they are definitely worth it.",

I have successfully completed 9 other courses, so this is not coming from someone that isn't taking the class seriously. I will be retaking in the spring (just dropped), and the reason why is simple: I never got ahead in this class. Fall 2017 was the first offering, and I didn't know what to expect. There is so much content you have to cover in this class that if you don't prepare in advance (as in, before the semester starts) you will never catch up. Grades are heavily reliant on closed book exams, and mistakes are heavily penalized. (Sure there's partial credit, but you only really get partial credit if your answer is mostly correct. ) You have to know the material well enough to teach it to someone else. One positive is that there is no standard grading scale for this class. After the first exam, the professor said that anyone at the median or higher was at a B. This view of the grading means that half of the class is looking at below a B. I mention all of this not to complain, because I think the content is important, but to let you know that you should be studying. If you are on this page looking at reviews, stop. Go study dynamic programming, max flow, and NP. Go study now so that when the class starts you won't be behind.",

Even though it covers such a wide breadth of topics, the course does fair amount of justice to them. All the topics are covered in a depth that you can get a fairly good idea about the topics. The knowledge you will gain in this course will not be shallow as is usually feared from courses that have a very wide course. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, I found the course to be fairly difficult. That is also given the fact that I did not have prior AI/ML experience. The assignments make us code various AI/ML algos from scratch with helps in a deeper understanding. Assignments will take time if your situation is like I had. Assignments are in python and good understanding of numpy can help. \n\nExams are open book and pretty tough but fun nonetheless. \n\nTA interactions are great. In my time we had at least 2 great TAs who were always active on slack. You might find lectures a bit too shallow but textbook and additional readings make up for that. \n\nIMO this course is a must if you dont have a prior AI/ML experience and want to pursue ML specialization.",

I used to do a lot more backend work, and this class has given me some better background info on some of the projects I was working on. \n\nThe projects are a split between programming interview / competition style Python algorithms, and lab reports based on experiments conducted using a simulated network. The 2nd and 3rd projects are hard especially if you haven't had much programming experience. The lab report assignments can be very time consuming, since there's a lot of graphs to embed into google docs documents and explanations to give. The tests are moderatly difficult to hard, so make sure you study. The later readings really pile up, and can be fairly dense and dry. The lectures are great overall, but can be a little unclear in explanations. The professor has also been mostly absent during the course, and has only given us one or two office hour videos. Luckily, the best parts of the course have been the amazing student resources. The Brainscape flash cards, the test prep notes, and the great questions have really made the class a lot better. Our TA (Stacy Stokes) has done a really great job in posting weekly office hours answering questions to help explain projects. Piazza can be hit or miss, since there's a TON of threads, and it's hard to find important imformation even when threads are pinned. \n\nSummary: Recommended.

Guidelines are given regarding grading, but they don't tell you exactly what you need to do to get a high score. This frustrates some people, but I think it's reasonable because this is grad school, not undergrad, and we need to develop the ability to do independent research and determine on our own what is important, what questions to ask, how to get answers to those questions, etc. If we can't do those things we'll never be able to discover or invent something new. \n\nYou are free to write your code in whatever language you choose. Mostly you'll choose a library with the ML algorithms you need instead of writing everything from scratch (which would require a superhuman effort). Python and scikit-learn are popular as is Weka and other Java libraries. \n\nThis course isn't about becoming an expert in ML (that would be impossible in 1 semester).

We didn't hear much at all from the Professor in Piazza or other forums but the TA's had everything under control. I was very impressed by the level of organization. The auto-grader (affectionately known as \"Bonnie\") helped to provide some feedback that was useful with the coding assignment. I think this course was considered one of the easier or less-difficult courses in the past but they adapted the course this Fall term. I'm not sure how difficult it was earlier but I personally feel this course is no joke. Some of the assignments in the middle of the semester caught me off guard and I found myself pulling all-nighters in some cases to get the project done. For me the Blending assignment, while very interesting, was the most difficult. The first two assignments were really good at getting the introductions to the material but about the 3rd project it got real, really fast. If you have some Python experience, an interest in photography, some level of Linear Algebra I would highly recommend this course. As a prerequisite recommendation, I would suggest getting accustomed to Numpy, you'll be using this in nearly every coding project. Also check out some OpenCV tutorials. Otherwise, enjoy computing with pictures. I rated the workload as 20 hours per week largely because of the Above and Beyond portions of the projects. This is a really good approach for a graduate level course, it allows you to dive as deep as you want on the material and there are so many cool things to explore here. I also appreciated how we had 2 weeks per project to enable getting into the material more (than having a single week for a project). Honestly some might be able to get by with 10 or 15 hours per week but if you want to learn this stuff, be prepared to set aside the time.",

Yes, when it comes to grade the assignments do not expect the best results, these TA's are like in the Olympus, untouchable. They use this autograde system that will never grade as a human does. Even if you are not very good developing, their comments or feedback will push down, making you feel like you are not worthy of becoming a developer, or something else, because we have to be honest, this master program isn't to make 'software developers', it is for anybody in the area of computer science: IT engineers, developers, architects, etc. The name of this course sounds interesting, but the content to me is awful. I don't know the reason we have to be doing like more than 50% in software testing if there is already a course called 'Software Analysis and Testing'. \n\nBy the way, get ready to be part of an experiment, when it comes to use this tool called 'TSLGenerator'. There is no valuable information on the internet for this, nor videos, etc. Nothing! The little you can learn you get from the Udacity lectures.

            "text": "I took this during the Summer semester, so it was accelerated compared to a normal-length semester. \n\nThe lectures were good, for the most part. One frustrating series of lectures was on live ranges and webs. Resources around the internet on these topics sometimes consider them equal, and sometimes don't. This part of the lectures seemed to gloss over how they're actually built, which was problematic, since one of the projects was centered around them. \n\nSpeaking of projects, they were useful, and it was cool to implement some of the algorithms/processes used in the various compiler phases. Grading seemed to be very generous; I got full marks on both projects. I'm not sure how they were graded or how many different types of inputs were thrown at them. There was a partner option for the projects, which I reluctantly took advantage of for the second project. Just a heads up in case you're anti-group project like me. \n\nThe exam was tough but fair. I was able to score well after studying the most important algorithms from the class.",

            "text": "First, the good: Professor Orso is a good lecturer and is passionate about the material. There are some interesting individual and group projects. I particularly liked the ones on Android and White-Box Testing. I plan on using what we learned about Extended TSL for automating test cases at work. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Holy hell, the TAs are awful. I'm more than half-way done with my OMSCS degree, so this isn't my first rodeo - this has been without a doubt my worst course experience. The co-head TAs (Will and Erin) are defensive, easy to anger, slow to answer threads, and almost purposefully ambiguous in their replies to simple yes or no questions (e. g. \"is X a requirement?\" or \"Should the behavior be X or Y?\"). I'm a pretty agreeable person, but I feel like I need to get my blood pressure examined after each interaction with them on Piazza. \n\n- The assignment docs are poorly proof-read, contain errors, and are often ambiguous. \n\n- There is an assignment due every Friday night (or early Saturday depending on your time-zone). Assignments are released the previous Saturday morning. This wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were responsive - but posts routinely take 2-3 days to get a response. Usually the responses are ambiguous, defensive, and over-all unhelpful. All in all, this makes for a stressful weekly experience. SUGGESTION TO THE PROFESSOR: Please consider releasing assignments 1-2 days early (Thursday instead of Saturday). Or work with your TAs to get better response times. Or have the TAs do a better job at proof-reading the assignments beforehand. \n\n- Feedback is non-existent. It's November 10th, and we're still waiting for grades on assignments that were submitted back in September. The feedback we have gotten has been one or two poorly worded sentences. A silver lining is that the TAs grade easy; but I'm here to learn and feedback is crucial to that process. Other OMSCS classes do a really good job at feedback, so it's definitely possible with a class this size.",

Deliverable 3 of the project asks to write test cases to cover 100% of the classes which are invisible to us. It made me like a robot when I spent several hours on trying all the combinations to achieve the goal. What is worse, the whole course is ambiguous. The descriptions of assignments are ambiguous. Most of topics in piazza are discussing the meaning of assignments. The TA (if not a forum mediator)'s answers are ambiguous. For example, a student's test cases cover 98% of the main class and he/she wants to know the weight of the other 2%. \"You can get partial score\". Do you think this kind of answer helpful? The comments of assignments are always ambiguous. I got one line comment for most of assignments even I lost lots of points. I have to say this is the worst course I have taken from this program. ",

I registered this course after reading the on campus syllabus (My bad), when I saw the OMS syllabus, it was too late to withdraw and waitlist another course, so I decide to take it. The on campus version included all modern technologies SQL, Tableau, D3, Hadoop, Azure, Hbase, Pagerank etc.. But the OMS version is basically week 1-6: intro to R and ggplot in R; week 7 till end: regressions in R. The syllabus speaks for itself, a more appropriate name should be \"intro to regression with R\" or \"the linear regression half of stat 101\". These knowledge might be useful 10 years ago when everything was analyzed in memory, but now... I'm almost to the end of this semester, I've completed most of the homework/project in slow Friday afternoons at work without watching the videos. I have a statistical background, but to be honest, the course (homework) covered nothing more than linear regression, I assume most of us coming to the program should have some knowledge of linear regression. \n\n The only scenarios I think you should take this class:\n 1. you need a low involvement course: eg. you are paring it with an intensive 30+ hour course.  \n 2. (more important) if you are in the Machine Learning specialization, you have to chose 3 electives from the 4 courses offered. If you have one course you don't want (eg. BD4H), you'll have to take all the rest of the 3. ",

The videos are good, but not the best ones I've seen in the OMS CS program.  The videos didn't always illustrate complex things such as DES, AES, RSA, and TLS hand-shake clearly, but supplementing with other sources and the book cleared that up.  I used the international edition of the book which is less expensive, but sacrifices the on-line material and some additional chapters which would have been helpful in a couple cases.

I also liked the fact that the professor provided supplementary videos that guided the students on how to tackle projects.  A big portion of this course is getting familiar with numpy and pandas.  Another big portion of the course is getting insight on hedge funds, and other types of funds, and how they try to use mathematical equations and fundamental and technical analysis to find ways to beat the market.  A final portion of the class is learning about basic ML algorithms such as Q-learners and Random forests, and gaining insight on how they can be used to make trading decisions.  For many of the projects you have to write reports that are worth a significant portion of the project grade, and you can even get 1 or 2 extra credit points on a report if you put in the time to thoroughly analyze your results.  I enjoyed how the online students were lumped together with the on campus students.  My biggest complaint is there are a lot of details in the instructions that are easy to miss but can impact your grade on a project quite a bit, so always read the directions carefully.  For example, you could lose 10-20 points for forgetting to put your name.  Staying active on slack is very helpful, because people will often point out important points in the directions that you might miss.\n\nUnfortunately, you will most likely not learn enough from this class alone to apply machine learning strategies in real life situations, but the class will give you a strong foundation if you are interested in exploring that field.

It's not horrible but don't go in thinking it's one of the easiest courses in the program, it's not. There's a lot of good in the course but it currently suffers from poor execution and a lack of communication making the course way more stressful than it needs to be.\n\n\nThe lecture material is good, the assignments themselves are relevant and have the right level of challenge. Unfortunately most of the assignments were not released when they were expected to be. Assignments would be released in \"beta\" form a few days or even a week after we were expected to start them. and then sometimes not \"finalized\" until a few days before the assignment was due. This is troublesome because some of these assignments do need the full allotted time to work on them, and if you waited until an assignment was \"finalized\" you would pretty much guarantee that you don't have enough time to finish the assignment. This wouldn't be as bad if it were minor tweaks being made, but the \"beta\" version was typically just the previous semesters assignment and there was no clear communication on what changed with each iteration of the assignment so you are left analyzing every line of the assignment over and over to make sure you don't miss some gotcha that could cause you to lose substantial points.\n\n\nThis is my 9th OMSCS course and this course in its current form isn't very friendly to OMSCS students who typically have full-time jobs and other responsibilities outside of school. In addition to the above issues, assignments also were not open for submission until a day or two before the due date in many cases. So even if you had worked ahead, you  still would need to plan around having an internet connection and submitting your assignment the day it was due. There were also random participation checks on the forums, punishing students who didn't check every day. In general it is structured in a way that prevented students planning around their life, and instead they must plan their life around the course. Most OMSCS courses I've taken have been more flexible in this regard. Students who suggested changes to the course to improve it were met with snarky comments from the professor on the forums.   \n\n\nIn general I can't recommend the course in its current form unless your willing to deal with the above headaches.

I found the projects to be pretty easy (usually finished them in a day) but very insightful. I enjoyed learning from the projects. The lectures were harder to learn from. Just like Info Sec the professor tries to teach too much in every video - makes it hard to focus. Plus, I never found a connection between the videos and the projects. The quizzes and videos quickly begin to feel like busy work. I think this class would be better if it had one more project and dropped either the final exam or the quizzes. During the semester I took the class we had a month for the last project. So this would be a good class to pair with another class that has a lot of work towards the end of the semester. I also wish the TAs would have graded things with a little more care. I had to submit regrade requests for every project. Also, the project's instructions were really hard to follow sometimes.\n\nOverall, a good class if you are new to security. Probably easier if you take Info Sec first. ",

I rated it medium because really most of the projects took me around 6 hours to complete. Which I really don't think is bad. There were really only two projects that took around 8-10 hours to complete so in the end I rated it medium because most of the projects were. On average with assignments and lectures (plus the occasional reading), I would say it took me around 12 hours a week. That's on the high side again given that homework is due usually every other week. That being said here's the review. The course is really split into two sections. The front half is a lot of stock and market information with hands on Python assignments to supplement the learning. The latter half of the course is more machine learning in conjunction with Python and stock and finances. You don't need to be an experience python user to take this course. Though I did have experience using the Python libraries and Python is a language I program in every day so it will certainly help. Also, you don't have to be a stock expert. The lectures are straightforward an well laid out in nice manageable chunks. In fact most were 1 hour lectures I could easily do during my lunch if I wanted. The profession is very knowledgeable, funny, and a good presenter; you'll enjoy watching the lectures. This class really glances over a few machine learning algorithms and you'll program a few but I wouldn't say it's a full deep dive into Machine Learning. In fact it's really about using algorithms to trade stocks and manage portfolios. This of course makes it solid intro class. There were of course some drawbacks. Communications throughout the semester was terrible. Reddit was used instead of Piazza for this semester which I think threw a lot of non-reddit users through a loop. I happen to use it often but it made the threads really noisy and messy with people asking numerous redundant questions and not putting comments in the right threads. Additionally, communication from the professor was far and few between. Assignment \"updates\" or comments about questions in the reddit threads (which could easily grow in the few thousands) were fair game for requirements on assignments (even if not listed on the rubric). Assignments were hardly finalized until a 3-5 days before their due date and portals to submit were often times opened days before they were actually due. My TA was impossible to get ahold of throughout the semester. The assignments tended to have subtle but time consuming changes that needed to happen each week (one week give the output in this dataframe and the next is needs to be a series or another datatype). This wouldn't be bad overall if two things happened. 1. There was a blip or sample of what the output should look like. 2. Each week you weren't forced to retool your other classes and functions to accommodate the returns to be some new data type for the input of a new function. Overall, the factors above speak for themselves. I found the course engaging and entertaining enough to give it a Liked, I didn't spend forever on it each week, and it was fairly average difficulty wise.",

I've compared it with students who took it on-campus a couple years ago and there's a staggering difference.\n2 closed book exams, rather than 1 open-note midterm.\nOptional \"difficult\" extra credit assignments have become full fledged assignments.\n\nThe class is great overall. My favorite aspect was the implementation of learning algorithms. I took RL and ML beforehand, but they were more theory based or had you use libraries. I felt like this refined some of my ML knowledge. I didn't know much about finance or the stock market coming in, so I appreciated taking that away from the class as well.\n\nGetting a good grade is another story. There is no curve, and I could see it being easy to mess up one assignment and totally kill any hope of you getting an A or B. Thus in order to succeed, you have to come at it in full-force. Don't underestimate some of the assignments. Start early or learn regret the hard way.\n\nThe workload is medium. Probably just the right amount of class-work for someone employed full-time. Sometimes I would have to devote all of Saturday or my entire weekend to the class.\n\nThe professor has nice lectures, but the reddit format was painful despite being a \"redditor\". Join a discussion late, and your comments will go buried. I agree with the other poster who mentioned that the class isn't the most flexible around the online student's time. You have to make sacrifices to accommodate the class's flimsical finalization of assignments, with short deadlines.\n\nIf I were to go back in time, I'd still take the class again.",

I had a strong non-Python programming background as well as an intro Python class and I  found the class pretty easy. However, people with less experience found it had a very steep learning curve and could be very difficult.\n\nAssignments are released weekly but you have two weeks to do them. The first programming exam was timed (2 hours), but after feedback from students they decided to change it to a 24 hour exam that must be completed within a 7-day window. I found the exam still only took me 2-3 hours to complete. The final was also 24 hours in 7 days, so they will likely keep that format going forward. \n\nAssignments and exams are in Jupyter notebooks that walk you though the exercises. Lectures correspond to most of the notebooks, but if you're a quick learner you can get almost all the material just from the notebook. Instead of writing the entire large program, the notebook includes some code written by the instructors and you write code to fill in the blanks.\n\nOverall, I found it pretty easy, and it paired well with ISYE 6501 (Intro Analytics). The instructors had some trouble with getting assignments up on time, class organization, and responding to Piazza in a timely manner, but I think most of that had to do with the fact it was the first semester the course was offered online.\n\nMy one course content complaint would be that the end of the course, which seemed like the whole point/the culmination of the course, was extremely rushed at the end (3 shorter assignments due within 2 days of each other). I wish less time had been spent on the Python basics at the beginning and more time was spent on that actual analytical modeling methods.",

That said, it is worth having some programming background and taking an R intro course before starting the class since there is a very steep learning curve. Lecture videos were interesting and easy to follow. The course project, despite being a fairly large portion of the grade, does not take a ton of time to complete. Peer grading could be a struggle since the grading standards are fairly open-ended. The exams are multiple choice and matching, but are actually quite tricky. None of the concepts are overly difficult to comprehend, but the question phrasing and deeper connections make the exams more challenging than you would expect.

            "text": "Not a good class.\n\nMaterial: The first half of the class teaches you some outdated APIs with little to no documentations, which feel like some orphaned research project. I fail to see how they can be any use once you move outside of academia. Second half teaches you tools that may actually be useful, but less than 50% good does not make up for the horrid 50%.\nAssignments: Extremely frustrating. Some assignments are extremely easy while the some are very difficult, not because you learn some difficult yet interesting concept, but because they are designed to be - otherwise all the assignments will take only a few hours to complete. Most assignments are auto-graded, so if you have typos in your typed answer don't expect any leniency. There's no Slack chat for the class - again if one existed the assignments would have been super easy. Some can be completed by \"throwing random inputs at the wall and see what sticks\", which is actually a valid testing framework, according to some lecture.\nLectures: Difficult concepts are skimped, while lecturer spends a lot of time explaining obvious, common-sense concepts. Lectures are mostly disconnected with assignments. Expect maybe 10 minutes of useful materials and 30 minutes of filler contents, and unlike ESPN the filler contents can give you a coma. Examples are not adequate so the office hours are mandatory if you want to understand what's going on, which you really don't since....\nExams: Completely different from the samples and the lectures. I mean, seriously, if I didn't study Statistics in college (yes, statistics) I would have easily lost 25% on the exams. Esoteric concepts from lectures were drilled, so you have to really think outside of the box. It's excellent to get students to drop the class and apparently so, since piazza traffics pretty went quiet the weeks after the midterm.\nTAs and Professor: The Professor did not show up at all so we can safely disregard him. TAs work really hard answering questions and maintaining conversation but harder not revealing solutions. I feel sorry for them, since their hands are tied. The way assignments are simply prevent them from having a meaningful conversation about the concepts. Sometimes by explaining things in a non-revealing way they ended up confusing people. \n\nSave your time and $800+ and take another class. ",

            "text": "Overall a very good class for general computer science program.\nPrerequisites: Python (basic), C (basic), controls theory (undergraduate level). \n\nI definitely recommend taking the course, especially as one of the earlier courses in your plan of study. The reason being that the content, assignments and projects introduces a lot of different fields - network sockets, controls (primarily open vs closed loop with single and multi-variable feedback), system modeling, embedded programming and architecture design & analysis among other CPS topics. The course can be coupled with SDP course and I think the two together shall provide a strong fundamental mechanisms required for other OMSCS courses. \n\nI found the Udacity lectures to be very good but with lot of information. It is a good thing! I took lot of hand-written notes as I went through the lectures and that was helpful to enforce the concepts/theory/case studies. The assignments were primarily hands-on, i.e. programming in C or Python. Starter codes were provided for all assignments/projects and the tasks themselves don't require a lot of programming but it requires understanding of how the starter code works. Understanding involves ability to read the provided code and also run experiments with the code. This might require exploring some external resources especially in C or Python in case you have minimal experience. The instructors are very helpful and held a weekly Q&A session (Saturday), though not many students participated to take advantage of the instructors availability. Beyond that any additional information required for the tasks has to be researched just like in any graduate course.\n\nThe course towards the end introduces AADL (a model based language) for a project but the time frame to learn AADL was short and coupled with the project deliverable which made the project more challenging. But challenges are fun, right? I found this to be one of the best part of the course. It would have been nice if at least the last two projects were based on AADL as that would give ample time to learn the language and related simulation tool and also be able to focus on the required project tasks properly.\n\nIf you are interested to know about - systems at large, embedded systems, real-time systems and controls, robotics, quadcopters (lot of examples based on this) and architecture development, then take this course. It is a good introduction from both computer science and CPS perspective.",

This being my first course I can't compare to other GT classes, but this is easily the best online course I have ever taken. I appreciated the weekly YouTube office hours and was not required to post a mindless forum thread on a weekly basis, in contrast to my undergrad experience. The weekly workload is entirely doable if you read the instructions CAREFULLY and IGNORE your classmates' forum posts until you've absolutely hit a wall and need an answer to something in particular. Using this strategy, even while working 50 hour weeks I devoted about 4 days out of the week to schoolwork (this 1 class) and managed to get no less than a 94% on each assignment, I consider myself a software developer newbie with average intelligence. My favorite part of the course was the group project which we split up equally on documentation and coding, and I could not have asked for a better team. Having said all that, the TAs do take their sweet time on grading assignments, apparently especially if you choose to contest a grade (I did not), and I rarely saw any interaction by other TAs on the forum besides the two heads (perhaps they were grading?). There are some concepts that I would have liked to go deeper on, such as Agile, and the lectures could be updated with lessons on the currently used software.

Related, although I have experience as a software engineer, my current job is entirely different. So I also spent a good chuck of time creating a workable setup on my machine (Cygwin, .bashrc aliases, git). Finally, although Java is clearly stated as a prerequisite, my closest experience is C++ from 15 years ago. So coming up to speed there was nontrivial.\n\nPROS:\nProfessor Orso is a ton of fun! The lectures are great and the office hours are helpful. I enjoyed the material and appreciated the weekly assignment cadence. This course has been refined over many iterations, and the instructors are very clear that the decision to make each assignment due on Saturday morning is a deliberate one. Initially I was unhappy about this, but came to rather enjoy it by using some weekend time to get ahead on the homework rather than scrambling to meet the deadline. We were exposed to several technologies and tools (git, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Java, JUnit, markdown, XML). The Android Studio group project was a lot of fun. Groups were assigned based on mutually available meeting times and complementary Java experience, which worked out great! \n\nCONS:\nAssignment grades were consistently very late. I literally had no idea how I was doing in the course for the first half of the semester. (As a new student, this was particularly unsettling!) The instructors take grading very seriously, and go to lengths to ensure fairness by making sure grade distribution from TA to TA isn't skewed, releasing all grades simultaneously, and so on. I do prefer a fair grade over a fast grade, so I appreciated this. However, I think it's also reasonable to expect timely qualitative feedback, perhaps with a delayed quantitative grade. (Otherwise, there's no difference between OMSCS and watching Lynda videos!) I felt the lack of timely feedback hampered my learning and caused unnecessary anxiety.",

There is a Alt project after the first mandatory RPM project that deals with chat bot which I believe is more relevant than RPMs. Expect lots of writing in this class. I struggled with the writing assignments in the beginning but managed through later as I adjusted to the rhythm. In all there are 3 writing assignments, 3 projects with the project reflection associated with them, a mid term and a final exam. If you hate writing, this class may not be for you. Projects can use Python or Java. I would recommend brushing up your Python skills, especially Pillow and numpy for RPMs and NLTK for chat bot.

            "text": "Background knowledge:  Do not be fooled by the supposed required background knowledge.  They said we needed to be \"familiar\" with \"a high level programming language like Java or C++).  For your own health and safety, do not attempt this class without a very solid foundation in BOTH Java and C++, and experience in C and Bash scripting would definitely help to have in advance.  I went in not knowing C++ and we ended up having an assignment written in that language with a special framework that I got a 30 on because I had to spend so much time just trying to figure out the language and the corresponding special framework that I barely got around to actually figuring out the concept behind the assignment.  Don't make my mistakes.\n\nClass material:  There were definitely some interesting and useful concepts sprinkled in, but I work in this field and had never heard of most of the concepts/testing techniques in this class.  Either my company is just really terrible at testing, or a lot of these techniques are outdated, far too specific, or not used in the actual business world, and I think it's the latter.  There was some material that was very useful, but many of the lectures were incredibly boring and slow-moving.  Lots of time was spent on background and not as much on the actual concepts.\n\nAssignments:  This is what killed the class for me.  Assignments were either ridiculously easy (an hour or two) or impossibly difficult (30+ hours, and the majority were like this).  There were 7 total and I came to dread each release of a new assignment.  For me, they felt like an enormous leap from the lectures and I felt completely lost for the first third of the time spent on the tough ones.  Provided resources were extremely limited and lacked detail, and the concepts nearly always couldn't be found anywhere on the web, so I had to rely on asking the other students and TAs on Piazza for everything I couldn't understand, which was frustrating.  Overall the assignments tested our ability to figure out what we are supposed to do with the tiniest scraps of information as possible rather than our understanding of the concepts from class, so they felt like a huge and infuriating waste of time.\n\nExams:  The midterm was tough but I felt it was pretty fair.  We were given a practice exam for both the midterm and final and I felt the practice gave a good feel for what the real exam is like.  The class average was a 65 on the midterm, but the grades were curved soon afterwards.  The exams are open-lecture notes.  \n\nProfessors/TAs:  One of our professors was very dedicated, consistent with office hours, and was always on Piazza helping out and answering questions.  The other professor who recorded the lectures showed up for one office hours, which were supposed to be weekly, and then cancelled each week after that before finally not scheduling them at all and being replaced by rotating TAs.  The TAs were helpful and seemed dedicated to helping the students, and they seem like they had to carry a lot of the weight, so I commend them for that.\n\nThis was my first class in the entire program and it had me questioning whether the program was right for me.  I am hoping I will have a better experience in other classes.  Overall, I can't necessarily recommend the class but if you are better prepared (see section 1 of my review) you will probably suffer much less than I did.",

There were 5 projects, a midterm, and a final. The lectures felt very fast-paced and covered a broad subject at a shallow level, so it was hard to actually learn much from them. I agree with another student that the projects were somewhat disconnected from the lectures. Some of the projects even felt like they really belonged in Info Sec - as if the professor didn't accomplish everything he wanted to in that class, so he's using Network Security as a place to put the overflow. The professor's involvement in the class was minimal - I was active a few times in Slack, and often on Piazza, but I never saw any activity from Prof. Lee in either place, which is disappointing. The class was instead run (somewhat haphazardly) by TAs. The quizzes were poorly or ambiguously worded, sometimes such that there was more than one technically correct answer. Project writeups were often filled with errors or inconsistencies, which had to be resolved on Piazza, and unfortunately made the projects a bit harder to tackle since it was hard to distinguish parts you didn't understand from parts that were just wrong. Project skeleton code had typos that made one wonder if the TAs had actually tried to run the code before publishing it. The autograders were also poorly written, and many students (myself included) had to request regrades for one or more projects due to autograder issues.  Overall, could be a good class with interesting material, but feels poorly executed.",

            "text": "The content of this course is really interesting, though it feels to me like too much for one course - 30 hours of dense lecture videos exceed any class I've taken so far. The six projects had two week windows (plus a 3 week final project) and typically required tremendous effort, an average of 40 to 50 hours, and a peak of 70 hours for me. They mostly started off pretty cool - the coding was fun, the outputs were impressive - but typically had was too many parts, such that by the end the joy was sucked out of them. PS2 about sign detection was particularly atrocious in this regard. It just had way too much packed in. A notable exception was PS3 on augmented reality, which had a more reasonable workload (~30 hours), which allowed it to be strictly fun. It's my understanding that they redid a bunch of the projects this semester and it sounds like they got harder. This also meant there were frequent bugs in provided code, though I'd imagine this will be less of an issue going forward if they keep the same projects. In my opinion this course would be better off either split into two courses or with a little less depth; I was just so fatigued by the end that I really didn't enjoy it, even though the content is fascinating.\n\nI am surprised by the recent review which commends the instructional staff - this course has objectively the worst instructor interaction of any of six courses I've taken thus far. For example, there are a combined 320 unanswered questions or unresolved followups on Piazza, roughly 10x the next worst class I've taken by this metric. The ratio of instructor responses to student responses is 0.642 - I've rarely (never?) had a class below 1.0. There were commonly bugs in project code that would be caught by students, and the instructors would not post updates or even make conspicuous announcements about the errors to save hours of pointless frustration for students on already tremendous projects. The one glaring exception to this trend were TA Matt Houston's office hours, which were excellent. The actual instructor, Dr. Essa, was completely absent - no office hours, no Piazza, etc. In fact, one of just two times he ever showed up on Piazza was to attack some students who implied that he was absent!\n\n\n\n\n",

Let's start from the top: a class called \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\" should, at some point, mention \"Analytics\" somewhere. They didn't even try to connect it with the subject that 100% of its students came to study.\n\nInstead, this is a hodge-podge of (way, way too many) business concepts crammed together, taught with no connection to one another in four batches by four professors. The first lecturer, teaching business accounting, was absolutely atrocious. He clearly was just winging his way through his lectures, rambling with maybe a loose outline in front of him. Editing the transcripts into some semblance of a coherent study tool, it was possible to edit out 40-70% of the text without any loss of information, so redundant and bloated was the text. The second lecturer was marginally better, but his handwriting in the few problems we were given as examples was atrocious, and he would throw out acronyms without explanation.\n\nThere were far too few checks for understanding and practice problems, and then the homework and exams were brutally unforgiving. Accounting problems that would take 10-20 minutes to complete would have single, graded all-or-nothing multiple-choice submissions (and sometimes, fill-in-the-blank, better-get-it-exactly-right-the-first-time fields). All of the other choices were gotchas based on common errors you may have made because the inadequate teaching you received hadn't prepared you to do it exactly right. \n\nAnd then abruptly midway through the course, the graded homework stopped, replaced by a torrent of lectures -- nearly 100 more videos crammed full of micro-topics with no indication as to what was important, what would be tested on, what was intended to ground larger important concepts. The practice problems were absolutely all over the place, making it totally unclear as to what we could expect on the final. \n\nStaff didn't seem to care about student's concerns when these were voiced. Flury's most common response to students worried about their grade was that the grades overall were adequate. When students said concepts weren't clear, the typical response was essentially that, yes, they were. Oh, sorry, our bad, I guess.\n\nThis was my fourth online class through Georgia Tech and by far the worst. I thoroughly enjoyed the other three, and look forward to the rest of the program. Had MGT 6754 been the first I took, I would not have returned. The contrast is about what I would expect from a school with a top-ten-rated analytics program and a business school described by the Financial Times as \"third-tier.\" ",

The videos are mostly good, but I highly recommend people to watch David Silver series.  It seriously helps for the first 4 HW's and 2 projects.

Watching at 1.3x speed is a good idea to get broad strokes, especially if you don't love proofs.\n\nThe final is pretty hard -  make sure to study for it.\n\nFinally, I did well on the projects, but I somehow unlocked what the T.A's did not spell out. Which is that you need to write your report about what the project means, not what you did. Which may not be obvious, because doing the actual work involved a lot of head-banging and late nights, so by the time you are done with the work you may forget to think about why you did it at all.\n\n\n",

If you can't do some of the problems just do the best you can (they are only worth 5% of the overall grade) and wait for the solutions to be released and then go back and learn how to do the problems.  The exam questions are similar to the homeworks and actually seem a little easier than the homework problems.  Professor Vigoda says he wants the HW to challenge you.  So, if you can understand how to do them, you should be pretty well prepared for the exams.  To prepare for this class, you can go to the course website to see the topics and watch some youtube videos on them.  The MIT OCW videos were also helpful at times for a different perspective.  Dr. Vigoda places a strong emphasis on Dynamic Programming.  He once stated on the forums, if you don't know DP you won't pass this class.  DP boggled my mind when I first encountered the topic.

The lecture videos are excellent, he repeats the information enough that it sinks in better than some courses where they just state the facts and immediately move on.  I can't believe I'm saying this after how difficult it was... but after it was all over I actually liked it.  If it was easy, it wouldn't have the same meaning or impart the same feeling of accomplishment and that's why we're at GaTech, right?",

            "text": "This is a hard one to rate. If you're looking to learn about AI, this is probably not the class you expect it to be and almost feels more like a psychology class at times. You'll be doing a ton of writing. We had three 1500-word project reflections, three 1000-word assignments, a take-home 2000-word midterm, a take-home 3000-word final, and three Peer Feedbacks to complete for each of those. Coding is limited to your 3 projects, which for most will be focused on writing a program that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (Java or Python with Pillow/NumPy). A small group of students was allowed to pursue Alternative Projects 2 and 3 which focused on writing a FAQ-based chatbot (Python/NLTK). The lectures were well-made, but cover very high level topics. There really isn't anything that helps you synthesize the course concepts. The RPM project only vaguely relates, depending on your approach, and the assignments and exams make it easy to cherry-pick through the lectures to get your answers, which are often somewhat subjective anyway. The course is very generously curved with anything over the class mean being an A, so it's an easy course overall. The instructor/TA interaction on Piazza is great and I was glad to see Dr Goel engaging with students at least a few times each week, even while traveling. We had a nice community going on Slack, too, which helped build camaraderie and made it fun to participate. Peer Feedbacks were very hit and miss and probably should have been scrapped entirely for the Final Exam. Peer grading didn't affect anything, but led to morale drops when getting overly-negative feedback and a lot of confusion when asked to grade another student without knowing the correct answer. Overall, it's a fine class. It's front-loaded, smoothly-run, and generally fun, but you're not likely to come out of it with many new skills that can be directly applied to anything. As with most courses, though, it's what you make of it.",

            "text": "This is a survey course covering pretty much all essential topics in Machine Learning. The course does not dive deep into the implementation aspect of machine learning algorithms. So set your expectation straight! The two professors are really entertaining, they did a great job in adding colors to the materials which are dry in nature. I love most of the lectures except the one on Markov Decision Process. To me, it would be more intuitive to walk through an example of value iteration before throwing tons of equations at the audience. The course did exactly the opposite which gave me a hard time. Outside the lectures, the course itself is depressing. There are four assignments in the course. They are asking serious a lot for each. I would expect to spend 100 hours for each assignment to get to the place where they expect you to be. Unfortunately it is not realistic since i am juggling between job, family and study as most of us here. The grading criteria should be better communicated, my overall impression is that the grading lacks consistency. TAs give grade based on their personal tastes.  The feedback should be more constructive and to motivate students to explore more. To me, the feedback is only a list of missing tests which are only implied in the assignment specification. I was discouraged each time after reading the TA's feedback. Overall, this is a reasonably well organized course. The materials are quite dry and TAs are expecting a lot from your assignment without telling exactly what they want you to do.",

That is what the grading is like. There is another review that states \"... we need to develop the ability to do independent research ...\". This doesn't do anything in that regard. Assignments are meant to hone your understanding of the material and a rubric helps students focus that effort to ensure it's not a futile endeavor. From the instructors comments there clearly is a rubric they use to grade. You as a student are not privy to this rubric unless you took the course before or received it from former students. \n\nI wanted to really like this course. The setup was there for it to be one of the best courses available for OMSCS. However, it is not. The enjoyment of this course was far overshadowed by the bad.",

The udacity assignments (problem sets + mini robot) should be 100% and that covers about 40% of grade.  Be very careful about falling behind on project 2 as you'll want to have a good implementation of it as project 3 is a very difficult extension of it.  I think all told I spent close to 100+ hours on projects 2/3 together.  I would highly recommend a TDD approach for these later projects because they can get pretty complicated and finding bugs once the system is fully built can be very difficult.  Most of the assignments and early projects culminate in the later ones so if you fall behind or have a bad project early plan to spend extra time on the later assignments.",

Memorization does very little good on the tests as they are all about the application of the concepts (i.e. use the algorithms from class to show how to solve this seemingly unrelated problem that you've never seen before).  Understanding Big O notation is required.  The book is also required for homework purposes and reading it is also important.  Surprisingly well run for a first run course and surprisingly fast grading for a written exam based course.  Test solutions are hand written and scanned while using Proctortrack.",

I came into this class with programming knowledge (python) and some linear algebra but almost zero R experience and no analytics experience.   This class was more time consuming for me because I've had very little exposure to analytical modelling.  If you come into this class with experience how much time you need each week will go down considerably.  Early on in the course getting up to speed on R was a challenge but once I was comfortable in R the amount of time required for the homework goes down quite a bit.  There is homework almost every week.  It's well designed and if you actually try to learn you'll learn quite a bit.  I encourage people to use the TA office hours as confirmation of approach after you have tried to solve the homework on your own.  You'll learn far less if you just watch the TA office hours and copy their code.  Exams are hard but fair.  Dr Sokol does a good job of making you think.  The videos for this class are very well done and to me shows Dr Sokol's strong understanding of the MOOC format.  The videos are short and densely packed with information making them quick and easy to review while at the same time, packed with information. ",

I have my undergrad in business, but I am always hesitant to skip courses as I feel that you can always learn something.  In the end, I learned very little in this class.  There are two major issues with this class, one the professors have no clue how to teach an online course in this format and two, the content of the class is too generic.  The clearest example of that is their videos.  The videos are basically just one hour lectures broken up into smaller segments.  The videos are too long and inefficient and some of them (strategy and marketing) end up sounding as if the professor is just reading out of a text book.  The videos are generally long and rambling.  It makes them hard to rewatch if you need to brush up on concepts.  There is very little in the way of graded assignments and no homework assignments that cover marketing or strategy.  When I finished the second finance homework (the last homework of the semester) is was Halloween and I didn't touch this class again for almost a month.   The exams are fine.  The no partial credit thing is brutal on the exams.  So many of the questions are of the \"Pick all that apply\" type and to miss one and get zero credit is dumb.  There are high point value finance questions that are quite involved where one small error could torpedo your answer and materially impact your grade.  On the final 28 of the last 108 points of the exam were tied up in four fairly involved financial calculations that you are doing with an on screen calculator (set aside the fact that only an idiot would not do this in excel or without a financial calculator).  \n\nThe content of this class also needs a rework.  This class is so generic that you could require it in ANY non business graduate program and the class would not need to be changed in any way.  Analytics is NEVER mentioned.  Even when you're in the marketing module where it is obvious that a detailed discussion of analytics could add value, it doesn't happen. The content goes way too far into the weeds.  I am studying to be an analytics professional not get an MBA.  Far too much time in finance and accounting was spent on how to low level detail calculations for things like NPV, weighted average cost of capital and activity based costing .  I can see needing to know what these are and how they are used, but I will never be asked to take this down to this level.  \n\nThe content of the course just reeks of laziness honestly. Either the business school doesn't understand how to do online education or they don't care.  ",

Watch a few of them and you'll see the dynamic between professors Isbell and Littman. The order of material, the quizzes, and the examples are all generally good as well.\n\n* Exams - A midterm and a final, which only addressed material since the midterm. The exams were straightforward, covered a nice breadth of material, and were appropriately difficult. My only criticism is that the midterm had way more content than time to answer it. The final did not have that problem. \n\n* Assignments - Bittersweet (for me at least). Each of the four was relevant, rewarding, and quite time-consuming. My two main criticisms are 1) you are asked to think deeply on a topic you are presently learning, which, for me, is tough; and 2) the assignments are broadly and loosely scoped. Personally, I finished every assignment feeling as though I learned a ton, but each grade reflected just the opposite. More structure in the assignments would have helped me focus on what I needed to learn rather than waste time trying to figure out what the TA wants me to address.\n\nOverall: Excellent material that I've been wanting to learn the foundations of for a while. The instruction was great. I just wish the assignments were more structured.",

In my opinion, The videos are definitely the best in the OMSCS. The material is dense but Dr Bobick cuts through the math and makes it digestible. He has a great sense of humor, and even his interaction with Megan (the videographer) cracked me up several times. Even the seemingly small detail of having a black background was well thought out, and make the videos not too straining to the eye. The problem sets are hard and you need to get on them as soon as possible. Beware of the first major assignment (Road sign detection) because it is deceivingly difficult, and the video tracking assignment which was super difficult as well. The final project will easily take up the time of 3 assignments put together. Matthew Houston definitely deserves high praise for his high-quality recorded office hours. To conclude, It's a lot of work, but you'll be glad you did it.\n\nAs an aside, I was looking at the table of contents of the CV books on Amazon, and was amazed that the class covered MORE THAN ENTIRE BOOKS on the subject!",

There is 10% participation grade. You'll have to gather participation tokens by filling out surveys from your classmates, which they'll post for their assignment and projects at piazza. A tip is that at the end of class, people share multiple tokens for their surveys (like i offered to share 6 tokens to get my group project filled in). \nThere are 2 Tests, each valued 15% of your grade. Include the course material you've completed uptil now , and the assigned readings. There are 30 questions in total (1 point each) and 1 extra credit question (10 points), so a total of 31 question. The extra credit question can bump your score to 85% only. which means, if your score is 75 - 84 % for 30 questions, the 31st question can bump it only to 85 % ..

            "text": "Incredible class. The material is extremely interesting, and the assignments/project weren't overly difficult and really emphasized lecture material (although they were VERY time consuming). This was my first class in the program, but this course is probably one of the best courses I've ever taken! Including all of my graduate-level classes as well! Very rewarding, but very time-consuming.\n\nThere is a huge amount of material covered. It helps that Dr.Bobick's videos are not only incredibly well laid out and clear, but also quite enjoyable to watch. They're also very thorough, so as long as you can fit enough time to dedicate to lectures (4-6 hours a week) you'll learn quite a bit within each topic. Assignments matched the lecture material fairly well, and were for the most part well-defined and weren't too confusing.\n\nAssignment breakdown with estimated difficulty / time consumption for those that like this sort of thing:\nAssignment 1 -- easy; ~4-8 hours\nAssignment 2 -- hard; 40-60 hours\nAssignment 3 -- mid; ~25-40 hours\nAssignment 4 -- mid; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 5 -- mid/hard; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 6 -- mid; ~20-30 hours\n\nWe had 2 weeks to complete each assignment, and they were always back-to-back so there was really no break in between. Previous offerings of the class seem to have had additional assignments, but starting this term we had a final project instead of the last (2?) assignment(s). The final project had a few selection options, to further explore more advanced and state-of-the-art algorithms for methods we used in assignments and/or other material presented in class that we didn't work on in assignments, and we were given 3 weeks to complete it. Many people thought there were too many things required to be completed for the projects, particularly the convolutional neural network project, so it could easily take 70+ hours to complete everything. A lot of the time spent on assignments and even on the final project is parameter tweaking. Be prepared to have fairly well designed algorithms in place, but spend loads of time tweaking parameter values to achieve optimal results.\n\nThe final exam was open-book and the study guide was very representative of what you needed to know for it. It was a fair exam. As long as you can review most, if not all, of the material beforehand, and find answers to all of the practice questions in the study guide, the exam is not difficult at all. Questions tended to be pretty base-level, focusing mainly on overall concepts and important algorithm details discussed in class. \n\nTAs were for the most part responsive, but as others have noted, Matthew Houston's office hours were a huge asset in completing the assignments. The forums were very helpful for finding out where to go when you were stuck and/or for discussing the assignments.\n\nI highly recommend this class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. It would help to review some linear algebra, and numpy if you aren't comfortable with using it yet. If you have some time, you could try and familiarize yourself with openCV 2.4 as well, as you'll be using this package a lot in the class. Don't wait until the last minute to start assignments, start on them early so it doesn't bite you when the deadlines approach!",

On top of the long project assignments, there are 15-20 papers that are required readings.  A close to average Midterm score can be achieved without reading the papers, but just read the papers.

At first it didn't seem clear what level of linear algebra we'd need to be successful in the course—as someone who hadn't studied matrix manipulation in about 20 years, I was apprehensive. But the ramp-up was gradual, and they did a good job of explaining sophisticated concepts while providing surface-level challenges.\n\nI started the class having just taken CS1301x, also available on edX. I highly recommend students take this course (or similar) before embarking on CSE6040. I also took the GA Tech linear algebra primer on Udacity. I feel like I would have been playing an exhausting game of catch-up if I hadn't. If you don't have Python experience, get some before enrolling.\n\nI found the challenge balance very satisfying. It definitely broadened and stretched my understanding of the math side of data manipulation. There were times when I thought I was finally in hopelessly over my head, but a bit of research or just plain staring at the code eventually led to (very satisfying) breakthroughs.\n\nI appreciate how responsive the instructor was to changing the test format from two proctored hours to 24 unproctored. It much better measured our ability and concept absorption—and was also confiding to know the staff were listening to our concerns in real time. That's a big deal in an online course.",

You'll get a little regression, operations research, time series analysis, etc. Now, you'd think, given the survey nature of the class that the topics would be fairly high level, but they weren't. For regression, for example, we got into things like elastic net, and regularization, etc. Tests were not too bad if you did a reasonable amount of preparation (you were allowed a cheat sheet, both sides). Interestingly, I found that my cheat sheets really didn't help. I found that for most questions, I either knew the answers, or nothing in my notes would have mattered anyway. If you come into this class with no R experience, get ready for a steep learning curve. In my case, I certainly had some basic knowledge, but found that having a copy of \"Introduction to Statistical Learning\" came in handy. \nAt the beginning of the course many people freaked out due to the seemingly steep R learning curve. But, as was pointed out, the homeworks were designed more for learning than testing. As it was, homework counted for relatively little of the grade, and submitting ANYTHING would get you a 50% score. And, since homework only counted for 16% of the grade total, that means you could have done almost nothing and ace the test and come in a 92% course grade. \nHaving said that, I really tried on each homework assignment to do the very best I could. \nAfter the early weeks, the latter part of the course was a bit easier, with the written project more conceptual. \nOverall, good course, certainly increased my confidence in figuring things out with R.

The content was quite enlightening for me in that sense. Do I now know what's in a corporation's financial statement and what the parts of a balance sheet mean? Yes. How to carefully break down product costs? Yep. How VCs generally work and how they'd value a startup? Check. How marketers focus on segmentation, targeting, positioning, and those famous 4 P's? Right. What the heck business strategy consultants think about? Roger. None of which I knew before. For that I'm grateful.\n\nHowever, the presentation was extremely dry (like a video textbook, as another reviewer put it) and spent far too much time on minutiae instead of exploring big concepts, applying them on our own (which is how I really learn), or connecting them to analytics. I was expecting at least to do one project-type assignment, such as creating a mock business strategy or marketing plan, but no, that kind of deeper/applied thinking counted squat toward your grade. Instead, to satisfy the gradebook, you had to subject yourself to a merciless grind that I can only describe as memorizing shuffled decks of cards and hand-calculating answers to story problems that combine 7th grade math with financial jargon.",

Your homework assignments occur within a Jupyter Notebook that has test cells that determine whether or not you completed the exercise correctly. Having an issue with something? Then just copy the test cell data into a new cell and use that to debug you code. The set-up of the homework made it feel like they wanted you to succeed and were giving you the framework to do so. I wouldn't take it without some background in code, though - you need to have a foundation that this class builds on.\n\nThe part that challenged me the most was the last few weeks when we dove into the deep end with linear algebra. For someone who does pretty well with math but has never taken a linear algebra course (and thought it was a good idea to skip it...which wasn't in fact a good idea), I got to the point where I was able to complete the assignments, but I'm still a little hazy as to the WHY behind what I was coding. So, I'll be taking the Udacity Linear Algebra refresher suggested by another reviewer.\n\nThe midterms/final were discussed by other reviewers for I won't hash them out.

I find it to be a pretty finicky programming language, and there were nights where I struggled for an hour or two to figure out what I was doing. By the time I was done, I felt like I had learned a good bit, though, so maybe it was worth it.\n\nHomeworks aren't bad, though a bit time consuming. Midterms/final were a little bit tricky - you really have to sit and think through a question and pick the answer that seems the most right. You get a handwritten cheat sheet for each midterm and 2 of them for the final - and these saved me. But you need to put a lot on them since briefly covered concepts could be on the exams.\n\nProject for the class was simple enough and followed the format of other case studies.\n\nIt's not easy, but you learn a whole lot, and it's a great introduction to what to expect for the rest of the OMSA program.",

The projects are difficult (would be extremely difficult if your C/C++ background is very limited). Tons of papers to read. The exams are also difficult, though previous exam solutions are extremely helpful. Exam questions don't seem to strictly repeat, but tend to cover the same concepts.\n\nThe workload isn't extreme. I had some experience in C/C++ and most of the projects took 20-30 hours, with the exception of project 4, which is a huge project and took me well over 40 hours. I generally spent 6ish hours on papers and lectures per week.\n\nOverall, the class is informative, well-run, and the projects are useful and interesting. I enjoyed the class very much and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone.",

            "text": "I came into the class already knowing SQL and Spark in scala fairly well, and had taken the rest of the ML specialization already, so take my workload and difficulty ratings with a grain of salt. Here are some things that might be helpful to know:\n- You need to know how to calculate partial derivatives, use the chain rule, etc. You have to derive various update equations and then code them. In other words, if you weren't able to derive the equations, you wouldn't be able to do the entire rest of the homework and would get a terrible score. That could really rain on someone's parade.\n- You are required to use scala for Spark (except on the Group Project). You are not allowed to use pyspark. \n- There are 4 homework assignments and then a group project. No exams.\n- You need to know SQL for most of the homework\n- The first homework uses Pandas and sklearn. The rest do not.\n- The second homework uses Hive, Pig, Map-Reduce, and scala Spark in Zeppelin. You don't need to know Hive, Pig or Map-Reduce very well. Just do the practice lab before the course starts and you will be fine on those.\n- The 3rd and 4th homework are scala Spark. You need to know it pretty well.\n- The 4th homework uses Spark's Graph-X. \n- The Group Project is worth a lot of your grade. A lot of people did projects based on Deep Learning.\n\nWARNING: when testing your homework using their test scripts, do not assume your code is correct if it passes. Their tests are inadequate. Many students complained of having passed all the tests but then losing lots of points.\n\nPros of the course: Great practical experience in big data. The homework was very worthwhile and I enjoyed it.\nCons of the course: This course could be great if anyone on the teaching staff would dedicate even a little bit of effort. They will give you a set up for Zeppelin using Docker that takes many hours to complete and then you find out at the end that the set-up doesn't work, and in fact, when they gave it to you, THEY ALREADY KNEW IT DIDN'T WORK because it didn't work in the previous semesters either. And they still keep handing it out. No respect for students' time whatsoever. The instructions in general are frequently ambiguous or wrong, and no efforts are made to correct them. The TAs make brief appearances on piazza to give 3 word responses that do not answer the question that was asked. The professor of record has no interaction with the class whatsoever -- not even a single piazza post -- except each group for the group projects were allowed to meet with him for 10 minutes over 3 days of his choosing. Then after we all cleared out our schedule for the great honor, at the last minute, he cancelled and told everybody on that day they needed to move to day x. Which of course most of us could not do without any advanced notice. So I never had a single interaction with him. Lastly, the pacing of the course is bizarre -- almost backwards. The more time a homework or task takes, the less time you are given to do it. And the easier it is, the more time you are given to do it. The homework and project are not given out ahead of time so there is no way for students to correct for this.\n\nI still liked the class despite all this in that it really did help me become confident with big data technologies and scala Spark in particular. It just frustrates me to know end that the course could be SO much better with just a little effort.",

The lectures are twenty minute sleeping pills where a menagerie of different professors read slides verbatim and provide long, rambling, and excessive examples to the point of further confusion. The course content is all over the place and seems hastily assembled, as if someone just concatenated four standard-length courses into a Frankenstein's monster of business school intro courses. Grades are few and far between (the two exams count for 70% of the grade), and the professor (the one of four presumably in charge) seems to have little if any grasp on online quiz structure, having involved, high point value multi-step questions for which there is no partial credit (e.g. \"Select the correct eight of these fifteen possible answers\"), and incorrect responses that seem to want to actively trick students into wrong answers instead of guiding the learning process. On Piazza, when the professor chooses to make an appearance, he is usually combative and seems to often resent the sheer audacity of those who may want to actually learn this material. The course would be a poor refresher for those pursuing an MBA, and seems especially inappropriate for those pursuing a degree in computational analytics. Towards the end it became clear that at no point would any of the material actually tie into analytics, making it even further baffling that this course is foundational for the analytics program at Georgia Tech.\n\nFor those considering taking this course, I can simply suggest you put it off as long as possible, in hopes the course will be reworked or removed altogether.\n\nFor those responsible for building and administering OMS programs, I can only say this course is an embarrassment and actively damages the reputation of the OMS community.",

            "text": "So, this is my honest review of the class. The class is not time consuming with the exception of the projects. There are six problems sets (if I don't recall incorrectly), and these are easy to complete because you have the solution available to you and a video that walks you through the code. For the projects, a mini project in addition to three main projects will be given. The projects are very time consuming.  In my opinion, this turns out to be this way because the lectures and material presented in class are effective in showing basic concepts for this class, but fail to expand more into each of those basic concepts to make such material meaningful to solving the projects. Don't get me wrong. Even with the right background, the projects would be hard and time consuming.\n\nGrading of these projects strictly depends on your code being able to pass test cases. If you don't pass any of the test cases, you don't get any marks. It doesn't matter if you have a 1000 line code. That being said, do well in the mini project, project 1 and 2. These projects are doable, and you can get them done in a week or less except for project 2. Spend more time on that one because part b of this project becomes challenging and is code that you can use for project 3. The deadline for dropping classes is right around the same time project 2 is given, so if you flunk project 2 you will not be able to drop the class. It would be better if you could complete project 2 before the drop deadline to be able to better gauge your success in the class. This is something future students should recommend. Project 3 is the hardest. Spend two weeks or more on it. The connection between project 3 and the class material is the least apparent, so you will spend more time figuring out how to proceed with your implementation. Chances are that you will reuse your code from project 2 part b.\n\nThe nice part is that project previews in Piazza usually come a week prior to the release of the projects in t-square. This allows you to work ahead, which helps with organization and project time allocation. So, as soon as you get the project preview, start working on the project.\n\nAs a summary, my recommendation is to 1) Do well in the mini project, project 1 and project 2 to be successful and 2) organize yourself to allocate enough time for each project, and 3) start working on the projects as soon as the project previews become available.",

Very well organized, and a fair grading scheme. No grading on a curve so everyone cooperates on Piazza (within the 'no sharing code' constraint).  I could feel myself learning as the course progressed. Mind blowing feeling to go from knowing nothing, to knowing, uh.. something (Prof. Bobick style joke), and as an added bonus you will develop an internal clock that always knows AoE time. What makes the course hard? The sheer volume of videos to watch and assignments to complete in a short 17 weeks. Here's my time breakdown by week measured by Toggl, so you can schedule your accordingly: 18, 20, 24, 26, 22, 31, 32, 21, 16, 15, 24, 24, 23, 14, 50, 31, 16. That 50 is not from leaving the timer running by mistake - it's the time I packed in attempting to do the final project which I found incredibly difficult. The week before that with only 14 hours was the one I spent flailing around, despairing of being able to do the final project. Advice for others 1. Don't fall behind on watching the lectures! Watch them all before doing the assignments - even without taking notes and/or at 2x speed. They might seem to not be connected to the assignments, but they open up your mind to things that will help you do the assignmets - and certainly will make a big difference preparing for the exam. 2. Start assignments the minute the day they are released. Don't procrastinate because usually success in the assignments (especially if you're a newbie) is more a function of time than anything else. 3. Make an effort to post questions to the Office Hours, or be familiar with the assignment so you can benefit more from them - Mathew Houston's recorded OH were extremely helpful. 4. In the assignments, strive for 100% because the final project is 5 times harder than any assignment and you have only 3 weeks to complete it (took me about 85 hours to turn in something not so great), so it's likely to bring your grade down.\nSome criticism: The assignments have a lot of starter code written for you, so you can learn Python and OpenCV as you go along, however, it would have helped if the Matlab quizzes in the lectures were replaced with OpenCV ones (but Pedro the TA did provide OpenCV versions for some of them). The biggest criticism is that because of the final project, there are no assignments on the later sections and I didn't feel like I really learnt them.",

They're given the task of teaching the course\nGrading:  The 90% Above and Beyond is the stupidest grading rubric I've ever come across.\nProjects:  While interesting, I don't believe they'll ever benefit me.\nTest:  The test is open book and there are two attempts; this sounds great...but like another reviewer put it, \"turns into a digital scavenger hunt.\"  I also found it to be marred by difficult/tricky wording (most likely by someone whose first language is not english) with a majority of the questions being of the delightful format, \"Select all that apply/are correct\".  I did not feel that the final exam tested my knowledge of anything that you might take away from the course.  Also covers quite a few papers that aren't really discussed during lectures.\nTime commitment: If I'm combining the time spent working on assignments with the time to watch lectures, then it's about 20 hours, if not counting the lectures it's a bit less than that.\n\nOverall:  I was thinking about the perception specialization, but this course turned me off to that completely.

            "text": "This was my first OMCS course and my day-job is in Network Engineering. So I consider myself better prepared than most for the course topics.\n\nFirst of all, like reviews from the summer semester, the course professor barely interacted at all. I recall an office hours for the first test and there was one set of discussion questions. The class was essentially ran by the Head TA, who did a fine job, but it was disappointing to miss that expert-level interaction. And for a course with 400+ students, that's quite an ask for the Head TA. \n\nIt will definitely help if you have some background in computer networking, especially in Part 1 of the course. Some fairly complicated networking topics are not explained with an appropriate level of detail. If you don't have the background on standard routing and switching technologies you'll likely need to do supplemental research to handle the first two projects. \n\nThe tests cover a lot of material and the questions are fairly subjective overall. It can be tough to know what the \"best\" answer is. Still, they aren't unfair and if you complete the test preparation questions you should be fine.\n\nSome reviews have characterized this course as \"Network Programming in Python\". This is hardly accurate. The course clearly lists at least an introductory level in Python is required. The first two projects are probably the hardest of the semester, but both can be completed with around 50 lines of code. The real challenge is in understanding the algorithm. The code itself requires nothing more than the ability to use variables, follow control logic, and pass messages, all capabilities learned in any introductory computer science course. The undergraduate networking course required implementations in C, and those projects were much more time-consuming then anything found here.\n\nOverall, I recommend the course to anyone interested in Computer Networks as an operational discipline. If you just want to know how to write networking code as an applications developer, this course isn't for you.",

For the final project, if you want you can build a working prototype. \nIn summary, this course is writing, writing and more writing.\nThere are 10 assignments and 2 projects. There are two types of assignments P-type and M-type, P is based on principles and M is based on methods.\nLectures are very engaging and drive home the concepts very well. If you have already working in UX and/or designing great apps, then this course will be a cake walk and you just need to spend only 5 to 6 hours per week. However, I come from an embedded background with no UX experience, so all the concepts were new and I needed more time. \nThe strategy that works best is to choose a domain and a problem in that domain that you want to solve and a few apps that you can review. You watch the lecture on a Monday, read the questions to be answered for the assignment, internalize the concept and apply them on everything you do in the next three days, then just reflect on your experience for the questions asked in the assignment.\nWe have two proctored exams and they are a bit tough. Take proper notes while watching the lectures and diligently read all the weekly readings. The readings were made compulsory from Fall 2017 and 1/3 of the questions in the test come from those. As I didn't do the readings, my test scores are not great. \nThis can be easily taken along with another intermediate course, if the other one is full of programming like CV or AI then this writing will complement the heavy programming.",

            "text": "Very well-done course. It's hard to imagine a better introduction to the Analytics program -- you should definitely take this your first semester.  This course does a great job of surveying the world of what most people are calling \"data science\" nowadays -- basic data preparation plus a wide array of both machine learning and traditional statistical modeling techniques. If you put a good amount of time and effort into the homework (and don't just copy the TA office-hour solutions), this class also goes surprisingly deep into some topics.  You WILL want some experience with R prior to the course or you will be spending double the hours/week.  It is also a great idea to get familiar with RMarkdown documents since they are a great format for submitting homework.\n\nAlthough I ended up with an A, my only complaints about the class relate to the grade weighting and some exam questions.  First, the homework and course project are low weight compared to the amount of work required and understanding gained (16% hw, 9% project). In addition, one feels a bit cheated when the course project is merely peer-graded and your peers don't provide much feedback. The peer grading in general was not very helpful as I rarely got any comments, just a numeric score -- I would learn more with tougher HW feedback from an instructor. The exams felt unnecessarily high-pressure and high-stakes, because they were (75% of grade for 3 exams). While about 80% of the exam questions were pretty easy, 5-10% were subtle/difficult, and about 10-15% were just badly constructed -- either expecting us to \"think on our feet\" about applying/combining concepts that only got minimal lecture time, or having ambiguous wording/intent, or relying on a very artificial set-up, or making too many assumptions and providing too little context. Some were major traps for people prone to overthinking.  In addition, the exams leaned toward fewer questions with higher point values each, which can really bite you. Fortunately there's a fairly generous curve that will add 5-6 % points.  In general, if you want a solid pre-curve A, you should do extra reading on each modeling technique covered and your studying should focus more on big-picture, situational application and pros/cons of different techniques. \n\nAll in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned a ton.  Dr. Sokol's lecture videos are engaging and clear, including many examples from his own consulting experience. It's obvious he loves the subject too.",

Despite their own course loads, they were present on piazza (&slack) answering questions; both technical & logistical...\nThe only not-so-positive aspect for me personally was that a significant portion of assignment grades were deteremined by quality of report. This sometimes makes you feel that some technical challenges resolved/attempted were getting overlooked especially if you are not one of those who are good at reporting :).\nHaving completed more rigourous courses like CSE 6220(IPC), CS6601(AI) & CS6476(CV) where the reporting was not a big factor in determing the grades found this a little discouraging. But on the brighter side, it's gave an opportunity for me to improve on these aspects (which is definitely important in professional life).\nOver & above the computation part, the fun aspect was experimenting with photography... I used the opportunity to get myself a nice SLR (not mandatory for the course) & learnt quite a bit of photography during the last 4 months.\nIf you need a term break from the heavy load ones & want to have some fun along with learning, will recommend this course.

Ok, bleeding-edge might be a bit of a stretch, but you will learn something new :-).  Also, fair warning to those considering this as your first class. This class can take a lot of time depending on your background. Don't let the average workload fool you. My background academic experience consisted of predominately electrical engineering courses sprinkled with skeleton computer science code problems during my undergraduate program. My current job is a System Administrator and I hardly touch code. I can definitely say I this class took a lot of time due to my background. If you are like me and you don't have a decent amount of software development experience, I would recommend taking SDP before this class. You definitely don't have to take Software Development Process before this one to excel, but I believe SDP would give you the exposure of typical bugs software engineers/software developers would encounter. This exposure would give the student a deeper appreciation of techniques presented in this course. I believe anyone can take this class and do well if you work hard; however, to shave off time of some of the projects it will serve you well to have a solid grasp of C/C++ i.e pointers, pass-by-reference, STL, etc. and Java, some graph theory terminology i.e. node, edge, path, directed etc, algorithms of common data structures such as trees, linked lists, and arrays, very basic probability and statistics, and all of the common operations from Set Theory. If you decide not to brush up in these areas you can still do well, but it may be a bit of a struggle.  If you have questions during the course, don't be afraid to ask the instructors, they won't bite :-). If I had done this for the first couple of projects of the course, I more than likely would have had a better outcome.  What can I say? This was my first rodeo so I had to live and learn. Exams are very hard and will require a good bit of study time to do well. For my class, they provided a very watered-down version of the exams as a review and that helped a lot. This was my first of two classes in the OMS program and I did learn a lot. Hopefully, this review will be of some help to you and I wish you the best in your future endeavors with this program.

I loved watching the videos, and you learn some fantastic state-of-the-art stuff, like sensing road signs for self-driving cars, to how to create special effects like you see in the movies.  The difficulty comes from being asked to implement these things using just the math.  You've introduced to the topic, the theory explained, the math given and explained, and then off you go!  The problem is that none of that gives you an algorithm to implement.  I found it incredibly frustrating to interpret the math, and in the end had to conclude half of it was nonsense, unless that large 'E' symbol means something other than sum, and every time they ask you to subtract the mean (average), they are just kidding.\n\nIn the end the only reason I passed was because I ignored the formulas, looked at code off the internet, and got the source code for the openCV functions we weren't allowed to use, and painstakingly over several days, went line-by-line through the dense C++ code, figured out what it was doing, where it matched with the formula we were given, where it didn't, and rewriting everything into python.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of time, don't take this course.  You cannot skip a lecture, and will probably end up watching all of them several times, rewinding to go over some dense explanation.  If, however, you do have the time, want to learn some amazing skills, and can decipher mathematical equations with ease, you will love this course.",

            "text": "If you are interested in self-driving car technology, and who isn't, you want to take this course.  This was *the* perfect course.  It had a world renown professor, the head of google's self driving cars, who knows his stuff, explains complex topics in intuitive ways, is enthusiastic and has a sense of humor.  The TAs are great, on top of every thread.  And if you're into this sort of thing, it is E.A.S.Y.  The answers are given!   You can literally just cut and paste code from the answers page and put it in.  The TAs are ok with this.  The lectures are short, and there is no complex mathematics anywhere that you find in many other OMSCS courses (it's all simple trigonometry).  This is the best course ever, and the *perfect* introduction to OMSCS.  If you are just starting your masters, you want this course.\n\nMy only complaint is it was too easy.  Now, a lot of other reviews say it was hard, so hard they dropped out, and there was too much math.  Let me address this.  First, If they think there was too much math here, or it was hard, they obviously haven't taken a truly hard class, like Machine Learning, Graduate Algorithms, AI, Computer Vision, etc etc.  If they found this hard, I don't see how they would be able to graduate.  There is NO math required to get an A (again, you can just cut-and-paste answers).  \n\nThe reason people think it is hard is because they shoot themselves in the foot.  They did not ask 'is there an easier way to do this?'.  They did not read the requirements carefully, or assumed too much.  For example, for the projects, you are asked to predict the next location of a robot.  The lectures are about Kalman filters, and so many people naturally assumed you should be using a Kalman Filter.  But see, that is not anywhere in the assignment.  Why even bother, when it's such a simple solution? The robot is moving a fixed distance at a fixed angle.  SImple trigonometry will give you the answer.  The next assignment, the measurements are noisy, and these people again, for whatever reason, shoot themselves in the foot and try to use a Kalman filter.  It's non-linear noisy movement, so they try to implement the Extended Kalman Filter.  Again, there is no need to do that!  The EKF isn't even mentioned!  There were posts after posts on the Extended Kalman Filter, pages and pages devoted to the topic, for absolutely no reason.   Why do unneccessary work like 'calculating the determinate of the Jacobian Matrix'?  I have no idea.\nThe only assignments you're not given the answers to are the 3 projects.  There are people reporting 100+ hours on the third project alone.  I handed it in within 3 days, and got a 100%.  These people are trying to do it the hard way, like calculate probabilities for distant objects, trying to implement difficult algorithms like graph slam, all for no reason.  Sure, all those things were suggested in the descriptions, and that's what the lectures are about, so kudos to you if you wanted to go that route.  But, and I can't emphasize this enough, there is no need for any of that.  There's no move limit, you can ram into as many walls as you like - that means you can design the most inefficent algorithm you want.  You can randomly carom your robot about the screen and, while slow and ugly, will eventually traverse the entire warehouse.  I can mathematically prove it if you want.\nPoint is, if you're willing to solve problems in your own way, and not the complicated way, you'll do just fine in this class.  I didn't even know python when starting this course and my final grade is 99.5%\n\n",

I could not have wished for a better start into the program.\nI will say, however, that there is a lot of writing (in total we had to write 8 essays for a total of about 15.000 words) and reading for peer feedback (24 peer feedbacks in total, 3 for each essay) which means you will read and critique another 120.000 words.\n\nFor me it was perfect to get my writing in shape, get familiar with python which I didn't know before, get familiar with Piazza, T-Square and Peer Feedback in a class that was busy at times but not to bad in total.

The course is heavily exam based - 85% of score comes from 4 exams (this might change in future semesters), one programming project (10%), and home works (5%). The course also required you to read the text book (DPV mainly) and do the practice problems. Overall, course is not too hard if you have some CS knowledge (data structures, recursion, graphs etc). The focus is heavily on understanding the algorithms and applying them in new problems rather than memorizing algorithms. So it is very important to do as much practice problems as you can.

There were about 30 hours of lectures which seems like more than some of the other classes in the program.  It's important to watch them before working on assignments since the implementation steps for some of the problem sets are directly given in the lectures.  The TAs were great at releasing the problem sets and grades on a regular 2 week schedule.  Matthew Houston also gave well prepared office hours that he recorded weekly which were very helpful.  The final project had 5 possible topics and requires a lot of work; my advice is to limit your scope initially because you may otherwise try something too ambitious and not be as pleased with your results.  The open note final was pretty straightforward.  Taking CP first was very helpful for me since I hadn't touched python in a decade and I wrote more code for the traffic sign detection problem set than I did in all of CP (including my final project).  The overlap in some of the topics with CP also helped me feel more comfortable in completing the CV problem sets.  I really enjoyed the class and wish there were more CV classes to take.",

            "text": "There has been so much said already about the course that I don't feel the need to go into details, but I'll just say that this was my favorite course so far in my OMSCS journey.  The material is vast, but the goal is to give you high level understanding of a broad set of tools.  Specifically, the professors focus on what certain algorithms do, what specific algorithms are good and bad at, intuition behind how they work, and how they are similar and different from other algorithms.  The focus is NOT on how to implement each individual algorithm or how to use specific ML tools and frameworks.  I heard or read at some point (maybe even during a lecture?) that one of the goals of the class is to provide students the tools to become ML researchers.  I think this course does a great job at that, while also giving students the opportunity to pick up specific tools as they desire.\n\nIn my opinion, it helps to take DVA before this class if you are not coming from an ML background.  Even if you don't use the R language for the assignments in this course, that class can get you in the right mindset for what kinds of plots and plot-layouts to put into a report to make the best use of your limited space.  Also, that course goes into some detail on logistic and linear regression.  While those topics are not covered in detail in this course, that discussion is still a good primer for topics in this course, including things like brushing up on rusty linear algebra skills and learning to do write vectorized code.",

The first run of this midterm project I feel did not provide sufficient time or feedback, which will hopefully be improved on in the future. Make sure you get started on it as soon as it is released.  There is an 'artsy' component to this class, where you have to deal with taking good pictures and then talking about how you took them well in the reports. Personally, I didn't like the subjectivity of it. \nThe most disheartening aspect of this course is that you must make up something to get more than 90% on any given assignment. What must you make up, you ask? That's a good question, as I am done with the course and still haven't figured it out. \nThe final exam was open book with two attempts, however it doesn't test that you actually know something. It's more of a needle in haystack search where you have to 'select all correct choices'. \nTAs were quite helpful throughout. Video lectures were pretty high level and didn't get into the meat of the algorithms, which made them relatively poor in my opinion. \nIf you are doing the Computational Perception specialization, you have no choice but to take this. If you have decided on any other specialization, just take Computer Vision and you would have covered a large majority of this course, with a much greater depth of understanding of the math and algorithms as well. You will learn more in depth, you won't have to make up things to get a solid A on any given assignment, and you can avoid the subjective artsy experience if that's not your thing. ",

It is a disgrace to student taking time away from busy life and want to learn something useful. \n\nI hated this class with a passion. My final grade turned out okay so this is nothing personal. But boy was I disappointed.       \n\nThis is going to be long. Here’s the tl;dl: If you hold a business degree in either undergrad or MBA, definitely absolutely opt-out of it. You won’t learn anything new. If you can’t opt-out, perhaps wait until they rework this class. With the numerous very negatives I think they will have to do something about it.        \n\nHere we go…       \n\nFirst I should say I don't have a problem with learning accounting, costing, finance, marketing, strategy. In fact I still consider the very existence of business classes in the curriculum to be one of the highlights of Georgia Tech’s analytics degree program. But this class is just horrible. It has “Analytics” in the name, is one of the few (3?) classes created specifically for the analytics program (all others are existing classes from other majors). But throughout the class the professors hadn’t mentioned it even once, except perhaps the couple of times when they referred to us. They did not even attempt to relate the material to analytics at all. And it shouldn’t be difficult. I don’t expect them going into much detail on the “how” – that’s for the next class, but it should be very easy to at least mention areas of application. For example, in valuation there was this comparable method, in marketing there was market segmentation and evaluation of advertising. All have obvious links to analytics. They could have just spent a minute linking them to analytics concepts like clustering, design of experiment, etc. But nope there was none of that.        \n\nAnd then there was the teaching itself, which was a complete opposite of the awesome ISYE6501 where the videos were concise, to the point and easy to follow. This class had long (10-15 mins) videos where the professors were just reading from the scripts. A couple professors at least make some better PowerPoints slides, but the last professor would put a whole paragraph of text on the slide while he talk on and on. On the forum the professors (mostly just the main one since he was the one who interacted with us) were not exactly helpful. They could get impatient and defensive really fast. They probably thought we were either asking stupid question or trying to be smartasses. Their attitude really discourage learning. They could even get borderline rude. There was this one time when a student asked for clarification on one of the frameworks, and he would say, and I quote: \"Why don’t you google John Kotter read more about his approach\". Go figure.        \n\nEven worse was the homework and exams. For machine grading purposes, just about everything was multiple choice, with no chance of partial credits. You would be asked to do multi-step problems that involved creating a balance sheet or multi-year NPV calculation (by hand In exams!). If you made one single mistake you would lose all points – it could amount to a whole point (homework) or even 3 points (exam) on your *course* grade. Other non-math problem tended to ask about the tiniest detail of the material. There were also select-all-true (and sometime all-false! Better be careful!) from 5-10 boxes and again they were all-or-nothing. All of these made the homework and exams very stressful.        \n\nAgain, my grade turned out ok. But I just hated wasting 3 credit hours on this class when there are so many interesting electives out there. Avoid it at all costs unless/until you hear better reviews in the future.",

My only criticism, is this class seems to bite more than we can chew at times, lectures are over-packed and at times. Video lectures sometimes become too much \"illustrative\", and some of the useful details seem to get left out, when the lectures say this is just for the illustrative purposes. And because of this, you might understand how something works, but might not always understand why something works. I loved the idea of Above and Beyond (A&B) in the assignment, it did seem to align well with the spirits of the masters' degree. If you are planning to go with CP&R specialization, definitely take CP before CV. I am coming from 6+ yrs of professional C# and .NET experience, but regardless, I definitely would recommend some good practice with Python, NumPy and OpenCV, bring down your workload. The assignments are not that hard, but they might seem challenging at times. I found the midterm project (Seam Carving) challenging. The class let's you pick your own final project, so you can truly make the most out of this class. Final exam was neither too hard nor too easy. Do read the question twice, in the final test. I expect them to lower the velocity. I did not always appreciate when the videos ignore some of the necessary details. Overall, stay consistent, do the the exercises, spend time reading the white papers. Take the time to read the white papers. there are a TON OF WHITE PAPERS TO READ, which might seem overwhelming, but do not forget you are a graduate student, at Georgia Tech.

            "text": "I came into this class with little or no background in Python, Machine Learning, or finance. There was certainly a learning curve in all three areas but the course did a good job of introducing the material so that even a newbie like me could catch on. The lectures on Udacity are well done. The assignments are solid and teach you a lot (be careful, often they build on each other so you can't just skip one and think you'll be fine). \n\nI had two issues with the course - 1) assignments weren't finalized until a week (sometimes less) before the due date. The professor would say \"you can use the old version to get started, not much will change\" but both times I did that I had a few hours of rework once the final version was released. I am not sure why a course that's as mature as ML4T can't get assignments finalized sooner, my three previous classes released everything well before the due dates. 2) Reddit was not a good forum for the course. My guess is that anonymity was a factor, some students were downright rude to one another. Other students asked really simple questions that were answered clearly in the assignment or syllabus. I wonder if having your real name tied to the post would have reduced some of that. Also, the threads got too long. I had two questions that never got answered (slack was helpful when that happened). Other times replies would go on the wrong thread and it was confusing to read. I have nothing against reddit, but it didn't seem a good fit for this course. \n\nAs for workload, some weeks I put in only a few hours, other weeks were more like 20 hours when a project was due. I was learning Python while doing the projects, so that may be higher than normal. Agreed with other comments that the midterm was tough to finish (I finished with maybe a minute left, and I'm normally a great test-taker). I finished the final with plenty of time, but several questions were ridiculously unconnected to course content. \n\nFinally, the tone of the class was a bit off to me. Some of the professor's responses on reddit were rude. I've taken other classes in the program where I felt like the TAs and professor really cared about the students and their learning. In this class I didn't get that vibe at all. ",

            "text": "This course was very informative, but required a lot of work on the projects and especially on the assigned readings.\n\nThis course covered a lot of OS principles, both historically and relevant to today's environment. It was interesting to learn of many concepts that were \"ahead of their time\" and just now coming into mainstream given cloud and data center technologies.  \n\nThe projects were slightly harder than average difficulty and required good knowledge of C++ (in particular C++ 11). Coming from a C++/embedded background this was not too difficult, but given some of the Piazza posts many had problems in this area.  Most projects had \"multi-threaded\" attributes, so a good understanding of threads is a good thing to know coming into the class.  Nonetheless, all the projects had a high \"learning value\", introducing us to several technologies I haven't been exposed to (but expect to put into practice).\n\nThe assigned readings were also voluminous, with many of them supporting the lectures. Plan to spend countless hours reading these papers. Several details of the papers were asked on the midterm and/or final exams, so this is not an optional component of the class. Most of the papers were actually quite informative, though some went into a lot of details and performance evaluations, which could've been summarized in just a few sentences (I mostly just skimmed these sections and got the necessary information our of the summary).\n\nBy far, the most challenging aspect of the course were the midterm and final exams, which together comprised 42% of the overall grade. These tests were quite simply \"hard\". The tests did not exactly focus on the facts learned during the course, but instead on whether the student understood the concepts/facts and could make additional deductions on those facts.  The exams, while still performed in Verificent/Proctortrack were all essay type questions. Even the True/False questions required an explanation in order to get credit.  The exams were definitely comprehensive over the material.\n\nThe lectures were actually quite good. The professor took the time to convey key concepts, including examples and details. Of course, his lectures were primarily an overview with examples of the assigned readings. The TAs were quite helpful and responsive on Piazza.\n\nPerhaps the only negative (I consider the \"difficulty of the course a positive) was that the projects took a long time to be graded.  At midterm (i.e., time to withdraw), only about 30% of the grades had been posted.  This may have been caused by significant events during the early part of the semester (Hurricane Irma, Harvey and Katia) that impacted a lot of students (and in the case of Irma the Atlanta campus).  A special 1 time \"late forgiveness\" policy was however, introduced to accommodate those impacted by these storms.  I was a little disappointed in that the course did not go into more \"kernel level\"  OS details, but stayed a little higher level detailing how OS support newer technologies such as security, data centers and distributed computing systems, which seems to be more of the trend.\n\nI would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in distributed systems. Don't be misled into believing that the course is just an advanced undergraduate OS type course. You'll learn a lot in this course, but you'll also work hard to do well and be glad you took it (after it's over).",

I did 2 semesters of Calculus over 25 years ago (as well as a semester of linear algebra).\nThe homeworks and projects were generally OK. Homework 3 required you to code logistic regression by hand, when there are perfectly good functions built in, so that was pretty absurd. Especially since the lectures were very high level. It was basically the old game where they teach you how to draw an owl by drawing 2 ovals and then in the next frame show you a finished detailed owl. Good luck with that one.\nThis was my first class. If my next semester is the same experience, I will be dropping out.

There are a lot of ambivalent requirements which generated tons of questions in Piazza, which led to lengthy discussions that turns into bad feeling and snarky arguments. There is no helpfulness or positive encouragement provided in learning. Lots of negative responses and sarcasm. First, you need to search and read through all piazza posts before asking your question (to avoid annoying the TAs). Second, you didn't get a straight answer most of the time, so might as well do the research yourself. My take on group project: there will always be someone who doesn't do any work. With that in mind, always focused on your own learning and not worry with what other people do or don't. If you're lucky to find good people, it's a bonus!  if not, that's okay too. The exams are open book and open note, total 4 exams. They are difficult and tricky. The project is painful and lots of UI work (such as dynamic drop-down parameters).  Use PHP to create the project because there will be examples provided. I would avoid this class. ",

Two of the projects are more challenging, but still reasonable.

I initially put in way more than 20 hours/week during the first assignment until I figured out how to get help from the TAs using Piazza.  Using Piazza and the student Slack channel made my life much easier.  The material was still very challenging but getting to the resources I needed to solve the problems was much more efficient.",

            "text": "Ok, without too much lyrics here is what you need to do in order to succeed in this class:\n\n1. Become good at dynamic programming! This one is the most important and the hardest. Learn how to solve typical most common problems like LIS, LCS etc. Get Dasgupta algorithms book and start solving DP problems (chapter 6). Learn how to write a recurrence and pseudocode for them using pencil and paper! Once you are comfortable - go to leetcode, or hackerrank and practice them as much as you can. Code them if you want, but keep in mind that you'd have to be able to HANDWRITE your solutions!\n\n2. Learn about roots of unity in the context of Fast Fourier Transform. To be more precise - understand, how to multiply 2 integers using FFT Divide&Conquer approach. This one is also one of the most challenging topics. The lectures are good, but assuming you know the basics, which I didn't, so I had to dig all over the internet to understand it.\n\n(If you are good with 2 things above - you'll most likely succeed. Other stuff is also important, but not as much as previous 2. You'd still have to practice all of it, but other topics a bit easier to grasp.)\n\n3. Brush up on modular arithmetic, RSA cryptosystem and all the theory behind it.\n\n4. Learn the basics of the graph theory: paths, flows, spanning trees, DFS, BFS, SCC, Djkstra etc.\n\n5. Don't worry too much about proving problems to be NP-complete, those are fairly straightforward, although, practicing wouldn't hurt at all.\n\n6. Practice linear programming problems, but only after you are good at 1 and 2 (or if 3rd exam is approaching).\n\n7. Make sure you have enough time for the entire semester, and don't hope for the last night preparation. It won't work, unless you are already pro in all the topics above. \n\n8. Do all the homeworks, and do them EARLY!!! They are hard, although worth almost nothing in terms of grade. Doing them is crucial for quality exam preparation, and if you don't do them - you're screwed!\n\n9. Do not rush dropping the course if you screw up on the first exam. There will be plenty of opportunities to catch up, at last you can drop with W after the 2nd exam (if nothing changes next semesters).\n\nThe course is absolutely amazing, and it will develop your brain big time. The lectures are of the highest quality and very helpful. So, work hard, be optimistic, and good luck!\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

Listening to the weekly lectures and taking notes alone took me about 10 to 15 hours per week because I had to rewatch them several times to fully understand the topics. Doing the homework took about 5 hours or more per week. And, I spent about 20 hours or more per week to work on extra problems and reading. And so, on average, this class took me about 35 to 40 hours of studying per week. Can you do with much less amount of time? Absolutely! But it depends on a few factors. First, it depends on your goal: are you okay with a B (I'm not; I want my A)? I know some students who spent 10 to 15 hours a week, but were struggling to get into the B range or were solidly in the B range. Second, it depends on your background: are you familiar with the topics already (I'm not) or are you the brilliant type (I'm not; I have to work hard to get my As)?\n\nThe exams were hard but fair. They weren't tricky, but you absolutely need to be careful lest you'd make silly mistakes. But, from personal experience, and from what I gathered from Piazza, it was almost inevitable that people would make small mistakes, some of which had disproportionately large deductions, and so don't kick yourself too hard when you do make those types of mistakes.\n \nTake my review with a grain of salt. I'm the type who pushes myself very, very hard to fully master everything about anything, and I strive for the high scores in my classes, which I did in this class.",

In all other courses, we will get to do the projects where we get 1-2 weeks of time where we can figure out what needs to happen. In this course, we need to figure out in 3 hours of exam time. The exams are similar to homework but home works are not easy either, But you will get a week to figure out for homework where as exams can be very tricky. The professor won't ask any questions that does not make you think. He makes you think a lot during the course. The professor gives a lot of good hints on what to focus on during exam times. They are very very important. Pay close attention to what he says. He is very active on piazza and answers a lot of questions. The professor is very particular about dynamic programming. If you do well in this area, you will get A or B. Otherwise difficult to pass. He asks tough questions of Dynamic programming. It is his favorite part of the course. He initially scared the class saying that if we don't do well n dynamic programming, we will not pass. That happened to be true. This class required at-least 30-40 hours of work for me. So, my advice is not take this class with any other course\n\nThe positive thing about the course is, the curve. The B cut-off was 65% and A cut-off was 84% for Fall 2017.  Believe me, 65% is  not easy to get.. But the curve really helps at the end of the course. The text book used for the course is DPV- Algorithms (Dasgupta + Papapi........+Vazirani).

Well balanced and I liked it.\nThe TAs were generally responding, not amazing but good. \nThe negative was the C projects. Whoever says whatever, you need good C and a nice understanding of pointers. I spent very long hours debugging code which I felt was not necessary for the course. I did not learning anything about the OS. I learned about advanced C Programming (which I am not sure was necessary as part of this course). The other thing I felt very arbitrary was the extra points for the project work. The instructions were not clear on what exactly would earn us the extra points. TAs used discretion which did not sit well with me (but again this is my opinion).

I think Professor gave extra points for those questions. \nWill I recommend the course? Absolutely. ",

Assignments are basically experiments and documenting the same with no clear instructions on how to conduct those and what kind of experiments to run; I think the idea is to encourage students to explore and learn as much as possible, so that we get learn to decide what is important and what is not. Assignment grading seems unfair at times, and exams are very tough(At least for me). Advice from me; refresh your linear Algebra, and be comfortable with Python/Java so that you can work with ML libraries. At least be in \"listen only\" mode in piazza, office hours, slack channel to get hints on what experiments to run, what curves to draw in the report (I didn't do it, and that was a mistake)\nYou will learn a lot. Do not stress yourself with assignment and mid term grades. I found that individual grading may seem brutal, but the overall grading is pretty lenient. Just hang in there, do your best, and try to enjoy while you are at it. Getting a 'B' (or above) isn't that difficult IMO. \n\nProfessor Isbel is really really really good and very active in Piazza.

If you haven't done web development, you will learn a lot from the final project which is a web application. The database component is a decent component to the project, but there's a lot of unnecessary UI requirements. Many requirements are arbitrary and not relevant to the database (i.e. drop downs, radio buttons, printable pages, unit conversion).\n\nProject was terrible. It wasn't reviewed for accuracy or the actual technical requirements that students were supposed to get from it. It was refined over the semester, and felt like the instructional team was making it up along the way, which led to a lot of questions on Piazza. No rubrics were provided for the three project phase submissions. Grading is inconsistent. I had a great group, which made it bearable. Choose your group wisely and try to find others that can complement your skills for the project. There's a team formation period so use that time wisely to find others who are motivated and engaged.\n \nExams were fair for the most part. The last exam was pretty tough as some of the questions, especially calculation questions on indexes, efficiency, and performance weren't like those found in the book or sample exam. Still possible to do well if you think through it carefully. Be prepared for 1-2 questions that don't cover the content assigned in the syllabus. Be prepared for 1-2 tricky questions per exam that assess small details that aren't relevant or core to the course material.\n\nInstructors were not responsive. The head TA was pretty defensive in some initial threads which didn't create a welcoming or positive learning environment on Piazza. Many Piazza threads were never answered, including exam questions and project requirements. The instructor asked for feedback in the middle of the course (which many students appreciated including myself) after some students communicated about the negativity on the forums and the somewhat artful deception of the few exam questions I mentioned before. Most of those threads went unanswered even after the instructor said he'd follow up with individual responses.  \n  \nHope positive changes actual take place in future offerings.

There's some opportunity to do that by looking through the library and peer-reviewing projects, but you need to make time for it. Really recommend doing that if you take the course because you might find something you hadn't thought about or that captures your interest more.\n\nI'd recommend taking this course towards the end of OMSCS as you might have acquired some new skills that you'd like to apply to an EdTech development project. Such a great class either way! Kudos to David Joyner and the awesome mentors in that class.",

            "text": "I have very mixed reviews on this course. I think this course should be renamed as \"Applied Machine Learning\". To be honest, I really liked the instructors and their teaching style. In fact, that is the only reason why I liked this class. I used to keep listening to their lectures again and again until the concepts got deeply embedded in my brain. The instructors provide the students with a good overview of the theory and derivations both through lectures and piazza materials, but the students are not tested on those in any of the assignments. The midterms and finals were not that difficult, provided the students get accustomed to the structure of the questions beforehand. One way to do that is to solve all assignments of the past Machine Learning courses taught at CMU as well as the exercise problems from Tom Mitchell's book that do not require any derivation or proofs. I did all my assignments in JAVA using Weka Library and BURLAP, although Python would have been a better option. Assignments were easy yet time-consuming. In most universities, Machine Learning courses offered by the CS department turn out to be a blend of theory, derivations, analysis and quality code execution, where most students are tested on those. Here students are graded ONLY on analysis. In fact, students are provided with the code or the software for all assignments. I did not enjoy the assignments, as I did not find those challenging enough. If the students are serious about understanding the lectures, then they need to ensure to have a basic grasp on Big O Analysis, Differential Calculus and Probability Theory before taking this course.",

            "text": "This class was both challenging and fun.  It was extremely well presented and executed.  The material is derived from an excellent textbook.\n\nUnless you've recently taken an upper level algorithms course prior or have a recent and strong math background, you will probably have to work hard to do well.  Some students could have used additional preparation before enrolling (e.g., their math background was extremely weak and hadn't even encountered high school level calculus or discrete math).  If you fall into that category, take a discrete math course or find some way to fill in those gaps.\n\nMy advice: don't underestimate the importance of the homeworks and practice for the exams.  Do all of the homeworks, all of the lectures, and stay current with the recommended course schedule (which can be demanding).  If you find yourself having an idle week in this class, you're likely doing it wrong.  \n\nDon't let students who comment about \"no formal proofs\" deceive you.  Usually, that \"formality\" is seen at the undergraduate level and you are expected to prove your claims on much of the material (and understand proofs given in the lectures).  For example, having an intuitive understanding of induction helps with dynamic programming problems and when you get to NP complete problems, those are proofs.  Either way, it's not something to be afraid of but rather to embrace as part of your journey into the core of computer science.  ",

            "text": "I found this course to be a good introduction to operating systems, especially having never taken an OS course before. Since this is now my 9th course in OMSCS I've certainly run the gamut in terms of quality of courses. That being said, I'd say IOS is one of the better ones (my favourite and best being KBAI) for the following reasons:\n- The video lectures are well organized, the concepts are explained clearly, and quizzes are thoughtful and helpful in reinforcing topics. \n- Instructor and TA involvement was exceptional in Piazza. They fostered a collaborative learning environment which helped bring learning above and beyond just the video lectures\n- The projects were helpful and fun to do. As rusty as I am in C, the projects were a nice refresher and departure from my usual day-to-day work in higher level languages. If you start early on the projects and get involved with class discussions, there's no reason you shouldn't succeed on the projects. There are also plenty of extra credit opportunities that weren't hard to complete and ended up saving my grade. \n\nMy concerns with this class:\n- Exams: although mostly straightforward, they were tricky and sometimes required remembering one small lecture detail. The midterm and final exam weren't evenly split over lecture material with the final covering significantly more lectures. In this regard, I highly suggest that you keep pace with the class syllabus. \n- Grades: We received our project 1 and midterm grades back fairly quickly, but didn't get project 3 grades (which was due in the middle of the semester) until nearly after the final. Not having a good pulse on your grade was mildly frustrating. \n- Bonnie: Project submissions are handled through Udacity's testing framework, Bonnie, which had a few hiccups throughout the semester which were eventually resolved. I did like the instant feedback it provided. \n\nHow to succeed and other advice:\n- Keep up to pace with lectures, projects, and reading material. With regards to the reading material especially towards the final, I found that just focusing on the papers that were discussed in lecture were most important. There were some lengthier papers that, although interesting, contained far more detail and concepts than the class exams or projects required. \n- I bought the Silberschatz Operating Systems Concepts textbook but only cracked it open once or twice because the lecture material was complete in itself and Piazza was an excellent supplement for answering questions. I regret buying the textbook, but YMMV. \n- Invest time in setting up and understanding your C development environment. It will save you time in the long run when you're trying to debug a segfault. Use an IDE like CLion (free for students). It helps highlight syntax errors that you could otherwise miss. Learn the basics of vagrant (virtual machine), valgrind (memory leak checker), and gdb (C debugger). \n\nOverall I'd rate this course an 9/10 and would highly recommend it. It wasn't part of my specialization, but I'm happy to have taken it because it rounded out my understanding of basic CS concepts. ",

Even after reading all the reviews and professor's push, delayed to start the assignment and the price was paid in the assignment marks. I finished running all the experiments but didn't have time to write the analysis for which the assignment is graded. Write up is the key. Do not stress much on interesting data sets. Choose two data sets with different type of attributes, <30 in number and with <5000 instances. This will help in running the experiments faster and saving up time for analysis. Later I could score really well in rest of the assignments. Assignments constitute 50% of the grade. Midterm and final constitute rest 50% with equal proportion. Mid term was 1.5 hrs long and final was 3 hrs. Mid term is made purposefully lengthy. It had all T/F questions with 2 points each in the beginning for which a small explanation is required. Later there were 12-20 points questions. So time management is crucial for Midterm. Final had the similar pattern with double amount of time and it was fine. The exams do not require to memorize the proofs or complex equations but basic ones. I have used the following tools/libraries for assignments. 1. WEKA (Java IDE) 2. ABAGAIL (Java) 3. SCIKIT-LEARN (Python) 4. BURLAP (Java). It is better to start the assignment early and to get familiarized with the libraries. Its better to decide on the type of graphs to be produced and stick to them. I always got tempted to include more graphs but ended up not using them due to 10 pages space constraint. It is better to focus on important graphs and good analysis. Guidelines or sample analysis won't be available. It is better to read some papers and follow the format. I could only go through the videos after a point but not the readings, still managed to get an A and felt able to synthesize the content is good enough.

They can be time consuming, especially the latter projects. Especially if you're not familiar or comfortable working in C and a Linux (or unix-like) environment. A lot of other students seemed to struggle with the basics of settings up the environments needed to complete the projects.\n* For midterm and final definitely use previous midterms/finals as study material. Most of the questions are derivatives of previous years, or sometimes the same just worded slightly differently.\n* Read the papers! Read over every paper at least once to help gain insight into the topics discussed in the lecture videos.  And read the papers before the lecture videos.\n* Final course grade is curved. Everyone seemed to do mediocre or not-great on the final and midterm exams, but doing well on the projects and completing the rest of the assignments will help ensure a good grade out of the course.",

The amount of time you spend on projects will directly correlate with your knowledge and comfort level in C/C++.

Some of the complexities of the material is glossed over in the lectures only to be exposed in the readings.  Though if you correlate the \"hot topics\" of previous midterms/finals with the papers, you'll get a good idea of what papers are more important than others.\n\nOverall this is a difficult class but certainly doable.

The course is compared to a PHD in structure, not necessarily rigor, and I learned a lot about the academic development process. The strongest aspect is this class is the organization and communication which is led by Dr. Joyner. His planning makes it very easy to focus on the content of the course and if you do have questions, answers are swift and sincere. The format is unique in that you are assigned a mentor who guides you through the process of deciding on a project and fulfilling the requirements. There aren't any strong negatives in the course but I suppose the initial project dive is a little rough. There is just so much data to sort through and it is a little hard to pick the problem you want to solve. Fortunately, if you come in to the program with a problem in mind this is a non-issue!\n\nDifficulty:\nThis class is what you make of it. You could pick an really easy problem or a really hard problem, the only person you're hurting or helping is yourself.The first few assignments are almost entirely reading academic articles so get good at reading those efficiently. The writing is not that hard as long as you stay on point and have a purpose. My initial project idea was too ambitious but I was able to massage it into something that could be completed in about 100 hours which is the goal. \n\nWorkload:\nI spent a lot of time reading throughout the entire course so that never really goes away. The last 4 weeks was my big dev cycle and I ended up pouring about 25/hrs in the last week or so.

These lectures gloss over some details which force you to read the book which has moments of utility but is by and large, a jargon-riddled dumpster fire. The book uses some dreamed up syntax to express some of the algorithms which is pretty taxing to understand. The best approach is just to re-write the algorithm in code into you get the results you expect. The homework is very difficult because the questions are vague but expect precise answers. Fortunately, if you head my advice for dealing with the text book, you can use the same approach and produce code to solve your homework. You don't get credit for the code but it certainly make producing nice LaText and reduces the chance of you transliterating something in your process. If you can explain your approach, you might be able to retain some points but overall, the homework grading is very strict. The coding portion of the project is massive. Absolutely massive. I think it should have been split into at least 3 projects but that may have slowed the class down and there is a lot of ground to cover. I have no complaints about the project grading or what they asked of us. The project document is pretty vague and you have to interpret and justify a lot of your design decisions, just like in real life :)\n\nThe final was not fun and was pretty much like the homework. Treat the homeworks like a practice exam in order to get a feel for the final. The final grading has a decent curve so don't give up, always submit at least something. The way the assignments are weighted, you can't afford to skip any single task.",

            "text": "Fighting for an A in this class is extremely stressful but I did earn one in the end. I had heard great things about learning from Dr. Isbell and I was not disappointed in the least. It was an honor to learn from him and Dr. Littman. These professors genuinely care about how well and deeply their students learn. If you take this course you will learn a lot and if you want good grades on the assignments, you will work very hard. Each of the 4 project assignments took me 35-40 hours. My advice is to start on every assignment early and truly learn from the feedback the TAs give you on them. The assignments are pretty open-ended and they want you to do more than the listed requirements but also do it concisely, so a lot of your time on the assignments will be editing and making sure you cut out fluff and use your words wisely. Also do all the problem sets they make available. You'll want to get started on these early too so after discussing solutions on Piazza, you can fully understand the answers before the midterm and final exams. Also, don't use this class to learn an obscure tool. Use the tool most of the class uses because the instructors don't care about which tool you use and you won't earn extra points for using something unusual or poorly documented. The benefit of using what most students use for each assignment is that you can spend less time implementing the work and more time writing your analysis which is almost all they care about. Tools more common among your fellow classmates will have more troubleshooting solutions on Piazza. This was my 5th course in the program and it was probably the hardest I've ever worked for an A in a class but now my brain is packed full of knowledge about Machine Learning and I look forward to taking Reinforcement Learning, especially because it's taught by the same professors.

The class was a good introduction to a lot of OS concepts, and gave a decent survey of more modern concepts that many would consider to be application or domain-specific (e.g. data centers).  The material was lopsided in that the final part of the semester was much more in-depth than the beginning, and hence the final exam had many more pain-points of memorization than the midterm.  The projects were very illustrative of the concepts (I wish we'd had project 2, whatever that was) and didn't fall into the trap of being application-specific.  Strongly recommend C programming background, familiarization with GDB, and (probably) a solid understanding of the Linux filesystem and make paradigm.  As mentioned in other reviews, beware the details on the exams, and try your best to memorize graphs and charts as presented (they ended up being around 15-20% of the grade on the exams and are NOT re-presented as graphics during the exams).\n",

If you found your algorithms class difficult in undergrad, or have never taken one before, expect a rough ride (as you can see based on the other reviews). The homework questions were harder than the exam questions, so just be sure you can do the homework questions and you will do fine.

As all great things it did have its ups and downs.\n\nIn this class you will learn about: processes and process management, threads and concurrency, scheduling, memory management, inter process communication and various sync constructs, i/o, virtualization, remote procedure calls, distributed file systems, distributed shared memory, and some datacenter technologies.\n\nYou will get to implement a multithreaded getfile client/server, proxy, cache, and play with an RPC (this semester's was Sun's RPC) think how awesome all of these would look on your resume, also you'll be able to answer all of the AOS prereg question list https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/cs6210_diagnostic-preparedness-test.pdf. If your goal is to eventually take AOS, HPC, HPCA then this class would get you in great shape for them.\n\nThe lectures are great and require no outside readings to understand the material, professor Ada was very active on Piazza and held office hours regularly, and the TA's were friendly and very responsive on both Piazza and Slack. \n\nThe tricky part of the class were the exams, particularly the final which had more material than the midterm on it. So I suggest you study hard for it. There are some (few) papers to read through, but you can get through these fairly easy as there's few and concise.\n\nKEY to this class is to make sure you start the projects on time, the first project in particular is trickier than the others. The more time you spend on it and the better you do on this first project will be worth it in the long run. For each of the projects you have about 1 month to complete which is more than enough.\nI didn't do as good on this first project, because I started it very late, but managed to do good on the last two. So even if you don't do as good on the first one don't fret, you can still do great in the class!\n\nSome C will be good to know coming in, but I think that if you work hard you can pull it off with minimal knowledge, you just need to attack that first project really hard. If you're familiar with pointers, double pointers, function pointers, and using typedef and structs, then you're golden. If not then take the Lynda.com C classes (comes free for students) or grab the K&R C book and go through it (there's also a k&r c solutions book that can be bought for the solutions for the exercises) you can get those for under 20$ if you look hard enough, but just understanding the aforementioned will be enough and wouldn't take more than a few days of stack overflowing and testing on your own to get.\n\nMake sure you're on Slack since Day 1, you can learn a lot about the projects and get hints on them by lurking in the channels. This semester we had a PAID Slack workspace thanks to one of the TA's, how cool is that? To top it all this semester there were some pretty funny characters on it which made lurking enjoyable, however there's always the usual troll tho in there, but hey it's still a great resource.\n\nTL;DR: Just go for it; great class, doable/rewarding projects, friendly/active TA's, very active instructor, very C, such Threads, many Science, WOW.",

            "text": "8 projects (67% total) and 2 Exams (12.5%/each) account for the majority of your final grads, the rest points are almost giving it for free. \n\nFor each assignment, you can check the project details here (http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Fall_2017#Assignments). Do notice that each project is tagged as Easy, Moderate, Challenging, and Very Challenging. That's based on Professor's own experience, and MAY NOT suit your case. For me, the hardest project is manual_strategy, which was labeled as merely Moderate, while the Very Challenging one feels like a breeze. So, don't assume the time it requires for each project has a direct correlation with the difficulty labels. You may put yourself in an awkward situation. \n\nAnd regarding the exams, you'll need to answer 30 multi-choices within 35 minutes. You might argue about the limited time given, but trust me, it's perfectly sufficient to finish the test. I completed the Midterm & Final within 20 mins, and I still got 10 mins to go through each question before submitted it. No hard calculation, just concepts/ideas and shrubberies. If you could not answer it within seconds, I highly doubt that you could get the right answer out with more time given.\n\nOverall, if you 1) are interested in learning financial strategies, or 2) want to apply the ML approach you acquired to investing, or 3) need a intro-class before taking Machine Learning, I highly recommend this course.",

Its only weekly once during the office hours he answers the questions\n2. Coordination miss between the head TA and another TA (this TA was scarcastic & harsh in the response).  There were only 2 TAs as the size of the class is < 50.\n3. When you post private questions on piazza on how to proceed for a question in homework, the TA hardly cares and makes it public and waits for other student's response which you hardly get. So it remains unanswered till the due date of the homework. \n4. The homeworks don't cover all the pieces that you read. Few of the concepts won't be tested and the last homework was a copy from the lecture slides\nThings l loved \n1. The textbook prescribed. Sometimes you get that AHA-AA feeling.\n2. The project.  It helps you understand the subject well as you will be designing a compiler from scratch for a programming language.\n3. The course contents and the lecture videos.  ",

The only thing difficult about this course, speaking only from my perspective, is that a couple of the projects took me a substantial amount of time not because of the security related topic but because to complete the assignment it required knowledge of the project environment that I had absolutely no experience with; e.g., in the last project dealing with web vulnerabilities you have to work with Javascript, which was completely foreign to me, so I took more time learning about Javascript than figuring out the vulnerability.  Outside of the projects, I averaged 2 hours a week on this course to cover lectures, textbook, quizzes and exams.  But factoring in the time I took on the projects which soaked up a lot of time, it bumps my average way up.  They give you about 4 weeks for every project, so if you are not a procrastinator like me you should be good.",

            "text": "This class is no joke. I had to rearrange my life to have enough time for assignments. You actually program the AI projects that you learn about in lectures. Note that my Python (and especially numpy) skills are at best average, although my statistics skills are good. Fellow students were very helpful on Piazza. Don't forget about Slack, too.\n\nAssignments: Some of the assignments require really strong math skills, most require a decent understanding of probability theory, and all require good Python scripting skills, including numpy.  There were 6 assignments in the Fall 2017 class; you get to drop the lowest grade. The assignments are auto-graded and you get multiple (from 5 to unlimited) attempts to submit the assignment and you know your grade for that assignment immediately. I really liked that. \nExams: take-home exams that take 10-20 hours to work through. Exams actually promote learning the material that wasn't part of the homework, so I liked that about them. Make sure to ask instructors any and all questions you might have. Don't try to get what the question is getting at, or you'll lose all the points for the question. \nGrading: The class is graded on a curve (median and above is A, one stdev below median is a B) but note that the median for most assignments was 100% (midterm and final were much lower, around 75%). For the online section, A ended up being about 87%, and a B was about 74% . Don't bypass extra credit questions if you have the time to complete them (some are very time consuming and others aren't). As the class progresses, you might not be able to complete an assignment, so extra credit on an assignment might be the difference between A and B, or even passing and failing. \n\nOverall, this was a great class, one of my favorites in the program, along with KBAI. If you actually have the prerequisites outlined, you'll spend much less time on it than I have and probably enjoy it. ",

This class gave an introduction to Machine Learning topics as well as stocking market concepts and in a final project, allowed you to create a market trading strategy that was powered by one of several algorithms you learned in class.  The course used Python and was light in a coding from my perspective as a software developer.  If you were not a coder, getting up to speed with Python and Numpy will take a fair amount of time.  Thankfully, as is becoming a trend in OMSCS courses, most of the assignments have grading scripts so you know the majority of your grade by the time you submit your assignment.  There is the caveat that reports require manual effort to be graded and occasionally, there are additional test cases the TAs use that are not included with the grading scripts but still fit within the specifications of the project.\n\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable class that was fairly graded.  There were two exams that were worth 12.5% of your grade each that were 30 questions in 30 minutes.  As you'd expect with that format, you must be a quick reader and thinker but ultimately know the concepts very well to do well on the exam.  For those that overanalyze or how to think through each exam questions, you will struggle on this kind of an exam and while the exams are not worth a large portion of your grade, you do need to perform decently to get an A in the class.\n\nAs with most classes you enjoy, the Professor makes the class what it is as the instructor lectures on Udacity are extremely engaging and entertaining while also being brief and informative.

Almost all assignments can be solved in multiple ways both taught in the class and otherwise. \n\nFinally, having said all that I think this course is fantastic (but hard). Knowing what I already know I would do it again. I did this course with Intro to Information Security, but if I were to do it again I would do it as the only course as the learning outcome would be much higher. ",

I felt this was more like an undergraduate course. \n\nTAs are useless, they hardly ever reply on Piazza. The lectures are Dry. This was a self taught class and students were replying to each other. I was searching youtube and google for solution to assignment/assignment like problems and found quite a few. \n\nFor few weeks during the second half of the course I did not spend even an hr on the course.  \n\nTake this class if\na. You want a relatively easy A class. \nb. Security topic in general excites you. \nc. You want to take two courses in a semester and this one could be easier of the two. \n\nI would personally not take this class, I think it was useless from learning outcome perspective.

The great things are the lectures are engaging, the assignments are relevant to industry, and the course staff was engaging on Slack and Piazza.  The things needing improvement I felt were the assignment count and one or two questions on the exams.    The first assignment and the third assignment were both rather difficult so you want to get a start on those as soon as you can. The fourth assignment was not as difficult so that was a great time to take advantage of the extra credit in the class. If you bomb the hard half of project 3 like I did, you're going to have a hard time bringing up your grade for the remainder of the course due to the lack of assignments .That's unfortunately enough to sink you with assignment 2 gone.   However, with the curve, its still rather attainable to get a B (I received a B).  The exams were rather difficult and tricky. Most of the questions were fine. I felt that one or two of the questions were cheap shots (obscure details in papers that aren't immediately obviously applicable to industry /historical ).  I went over the videos over and over again but honestly still didnt do very well here.  Definitely focus on understanding the details in the assigned papers and don't put the papers off until after the assignments were due like I did (this was a mistake).  All in all, this course wasn't that bad from a difficulty perspective for being a systems course. It'd probably be a good fit as a foundational class for you.",

With this class there is lot of writing which consume a lot of time but there is an opportunity to get your writing published if it is unique and innovative. Though there are many concepts taught in the class about AI, but it was very hard to implement the same in practical life.

Exams are not extremely hard but they were designed such that you need to use the concept you learned and apply to the problems that are similar but different from homework problems. i.e. just memorizing the answers will not work.

Worked as an electrical engineer in power distribution between now and then. Full-time online student currently. No formal software analysis and test training in academic or work environment. This was one of two courses that I took in my first semester. \n\nCourse Experience: Overall, the course was worthwhile from my personal background. The instructors and TAs are truly excellent in operating the course and helping the students understand the material. The assignments are very effective in teaching concepts and new tools. All horror assignments alluded to in previous semesters have been removed. Some tools were specific to academic research and not necessarily widely used in industry, which may not be beneficial for some students. Everyone had to fight through the difficulty of obscure environments and languages. I had an abnormally large and painful learning curve for most assignments due to my deficient background, hence the 25 hours a week. Five different languages used throughout assignments, but I was able to figure out the appropriate usage of each given enough time. Once you endure through the learning curve, you realize the simplicity of the coding for all but one assignment that required a specific algorithm that I hadn't implemented before. The concepts and analyses are relevant as well. The exams require application of the knowledge rather than simple memorization. For example, given this type of analysis, find the output of the given simple code rather than recite the definition and characteristics of an analysis. I gave a \"liked\" rating as the lessons I learned on the assignments and exams were truly valuable but often cost me 20% or more on my grade, which can be a difference in a letter grade. Then again, one should have to earn an A. ",

You will use the basics of python for the assignments that are not exceedingly difficult. I simply had to transfer basic coding techniques from C and Java into Python syntax. This class introduces a broad and limited understanding of computer networks topics. This is not a course that will teach you about writing code for significant network applications with SDNs or otherwise. The instructor was largely absent which made for some easy extra credit discussions. The TAs were very helpful and effective and made the course successful. Only one assignment out of eight had a significant issue that didn't effect grades for anyone. Exams were simple memorization of concepts from the lectures and papers. I earned an A in this course even without the extra credit so I'm confident the vast majority of students would be able to given enough time to figure out the harder projects. Great first course or easier course to pair with a harder one. ",

The head TA, Stacia, ran this course like a tight ship and really made it worthwhile. The other TAs were helpful and responsive as well. Communication was frequent and regular.  I found the content itself interesting, having familiarity only with the basics of TCP and a high-level understanding of internet architecture. I think I would have been fine without any prior knowledge of computer networks. The first few projects are designed like coding challenges in Python. They were challenging and I really enjoyed them, but they seemed to be a headache for people not familiar with Python or OO programming who took to Piazza to vent regularly.  The later projects were less time intensive and more about performing a set of trivial tasks and then analyzing the results against what was presented in the class. Some people got lost in the trees on these, more Piazza venting. I think I was lucky this semester in that there were a few very helpful and responsive students in the class who offered guidance on a lot of the class topics by their ability to summarize and explain the material on Piazza.

Though it requires a good amount of work to be done for projects and assigned readings. In fact I am glad I did not pair it with any other course.\n\nThe course covers the OS principles, its history and its relevance today. It’s pretty interesting to know how latest technologies of virtualization and cloud have its basis on principles from the 80s and 90s. The videos explain the topics well and have assigned papers for further readings. I must have only managed ~30-40% of those (some 40+ papers are provided at the start of the course.) The midterm and final questions are not MCQs and require some memorization as answers are to be given in bullet points/essay form. However the previous year papers and solutions are quite helpful in understanding the pattern. From lectures and previous year papers one tends to figure out which research papers are more important from exam point of view, though others are equally important from a learning perspective. Midterm and finals are 42% of the total grade. Grades are based on a curve. \n\nThere are 4 projects to be done and they require good C/C++ skills (C for projects 1, 2 and C++11 for projects 3, 4). Even with knowing C++ for last 9 years, the projects were not easy. Project1 was quite difficult, with many test cases to cover and Project4 required writing a lot of boilerplate code(~40 hrs of work, 1000+ lines of code). However all the projects were interesting and offered something new to learn.\n\nProf. Kishore is a great instructor who teaches very passionately and the lectures explain the topics very well. Office hours happen once every week. I could not attend any live but videos are recorded and shared for later viewing. The TAs are also pretty responsive and helpful, I was pretty surprised that they accepted my request to reassess my midterm solution.\n\nOverall it’s a great course with lots to learn (you would not be writing your own OS here if that's what you are expecting but you will learn a lot about OS principles, virtualization, distributed systems etc.)\nAdvise to anyone who is interested in taking this course - be prepared to work hard, DONOT start the projects late, brush-up on C/C++ skills if you are not using it on daily basis, it would not be easy learning it on the go. And try to follow the schedule provided for watching videos, I missed the schedule after the midterm exam as I was employed more than full-time at work and I had to slog a lot towards the end.\n",

I honestly thought they were amazing experience into the world of multithreaded programming and really getting a good handle on C, and they complimented the lectures really well. I have never really wanted to hang out for a weekend, drink a beer, and do a homework project until this course. They will take some time though, so allocate time accordingly.\n\nTests were tough, but fair. Make sure you read the papers and the lectures, and study hard. ",

            "text": "This course is very interesting. One reason I love this course is that it tells the most important concepts in robotics in the simplest way. The advantage is that you can easily understand the concepts, but the disadvantage is also obvious that you don't understand where these concepts come from and you have no idea how to practice them when facing a complex problem. The homework are pretty easy and solutions are given to you so they give you a very good opportunity to practice your programming skills in python. Although you can get free 30% from the homework assignments, the projects are not so easy.  Project 2 and Project 3 each took me more than 600 lines of code. They are not easy, but not that hard. As others said, even if you cannot solve the problem with the concepts from the lectures, you can solve them using geometrically solutions. So, overall, how much you learn from the course is based on how much extra work you paid to this course. One bad side of this course is that you either receive 100% or 0% for project or homework, so a lot of students will receive above 95% for the overall score. So the cutoff for A will be most likely 90%.",

Overall, I'd rank it as one of my more enjoyable classes. Two things I'd recommend for improvement. One, the quiz questions seemed out of context and were many times pulled straight from book. The exam questions had alot of vagueness and felt were not written that well. The second complaint is that while the TA's were good about answering Piazza questions they were not so great at answering followups on Piazza. A followup question many times has as much meat as the original and kept seeing followups marked as satisfied when they clearly were not.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the class for the material and the projects were a blast and interestingly challenging. Only project I didn't enjoy as much was the virus analysis one. All the rest were really fun and cool. These was the best part of the class. I disagree that the class was super easy, I found certain parts hard and the projects always took some level of cleverness to solve. The exam were fairly hard and again the questions were not the best. I'd recommend the class and hope you enjoy.",

The TAs are basically grading that you followed the guidelines more so then actually pass/fail the projects.\n\nThe lecture material was good a lot of subjects that were covered was not covered in my undergrad OS class. They were very well organized. Sometimes I feel as the quiz math is a little hand wavy but I think that's more of the approach on watching the lectures then the quality of the lectures.\n\nThe projects itself can be difficult. There are about about a month in between projects, Slack/Piazza are very helpful even if the TAs are not around. As everyone says start on the projects early, I program only in C at work, and it's also this flavor of programming style and I had some issues, I can see how other students can spend lots of time on the projects.\n\nThe exams are very hard, and in our semester there has been some mishaps with the questions, and even some answer choices.\n\nOverall though the class is great and is very well curved.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the course requires Python programming knowledge; especially the second, third, and last two projects.\nThe three tests were all administered through Proctortrack and were very manageable if you studied the lectures and the required readings.\nThe head-TA (Stacia) was very responsive and definitely deserves recognition for how well she ran the course. The other TAs were quick to respond and grade the assignments/tests.\nOverall, CS6250 is a very good introductory course to advanced Computer Networks and to how OMSCS works. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject.",

For reference I had 50's in both and got an A. Prof Isbell wants you to understand the topics, not regurgigate reports or pay too much attention to coding.\n\nRegarding coding, you can use whichever programming language you want, but there are some recommended languages for some assignments. Code is not graded, so if you focus on delivering high quality reports you're set. Data visualization comes in very handy in all of the assignments to convey insights effectively in the least amount of time.",

There are 3 projects and all required C programming. I expected this class is for OS internal and it is partly correct but it spends much time on concurrency problem (a process and a thread) while it is still very fun.\n\nI felt the latter half of lectures are bit dry, and because we don't have hands-on experience on them (memory management, file structure, spin-lock, hardware related subjects, and memory sharing) through projects, it was bit difficult for me to understand and absorb all of what I was taught.\n\n20 hrs / week is just average and I always tried to complete a project as soon as possible, so after a project is open, I spent 70-80 hrs / week and after I completed it, I go back to lectures and spent 10-15 hrs /week. I recommend the same way if you don't want to be upset at the last moment...\n\nExams were not so easy, you should expect they are more complicated than sample problems. However they kindly offer a check list you should review before each exam, so by checking all of them, going through all quiz on lectures and sample problems, I think you can be ready for tests.\n\nAnd if you want A, you should definitely try to get all extra credits. This class offers a lot of extra points. I'd recommend visit the Slack channel if you get stuck on projects. TAs are more responsive on Slack.",

The lecture content is somewhat dense at times but Ada does a great job of explaining concepts and I found her lectures extremely useful. There are two exams that are certainly tough but you only need to study the lecture material to do well on them. I'd recommend reading the assigned papers but the main concepts from them are also covered in lecture and I didn't bother to re-read them while studying for exams. This approach netted me above average scores on both exams which largely contributed to my A in the class.\n\nThere are three projects whose difficulty will depend on your familiarity with C. I came into the class with no C experience and definitely had my struggles on the first project, but I managed to power through it and felt far more comfortable for the rest of the class. Despite this I'd caution against taking this class with little/no C experience unless you consider yourself a strong programmer, otherwise you may be in for a rough ride. The first two projects are both difficult and time consuming and I would start them as early as possible because you are going to run into issues with C/Bonnie/etc along the way. If you manage to get through those you'll find that the last project takes significantly less time. The good news is that you have access to the autograder (Bonnie) for all projects so you generally know what grade you're going to get when you turn the project in. I put significant effort into the projects and got full points on all three, though I know students got docked minor points for poor READMEs and other small things.\n\nYes this class is hard and you're going to get frustrated during the projects, but your efforts will be rewarded by a solid foundation in operating systems and you will no longer fear C.",

            "text": "Amazing course as an intro to OMSA or for anyone willing to get a broad understanding of Analytics concepts and techniques with R language.\n\n- Content-wise, I have found this course very condensed, there is definitely a lot to learn. The online format of the course is very succinct therefore additional readings definitely help in building the intuition. To do so, I have relied on various books, sites and blogs, but also used the discussion forums which are definitely a key to success for this course. This course is greatly designed and the knowledge acquired after finishing this course is definitely its strength. \n- Logistics-wise, on average one homework per week is to be submitted, the difficulty varies based on the content of the course, I have spend 8 to 10 hours a week between the course and the homework. The peer-grading can be frustrating at times, but equally rewarding when receiving a feedback on the submitted homework, which is not necessary the case. The weight of the homework in the overall grade is quite low compared to the level of effort. However, the time spent on the homeworks is useful to prepare for the midterms and the exams, which are more concept-based and of average difficulty.\n- Prerequisites-wise, elementary knowledge of R is definitely helpful to focus on the concepts rather than wasting time learning the language in parallel. Dedicated office hours will also help with R if required. Basic knowledge of math is required but the course is not deep diving into complex math formulas and theorems, which made it easy from that perspective.\n- Course team-wise, the course is provided in the perfect format, appropriate for online learning but still ensuring the quality of traditional academics. Real-life or project examples are shared by Dr Sokol with a pinch of humor throughout the course, which makes it very captivating and interesting as well, beyond the theory. Last but not least, the TAs are VERY present and supportive, which contributed a lot to the success of the cohort.",

Given the option of prioritizing projects was really nice since I'm not the greatest test taker.",

The class forum on reddit was challenging to keep up with after having been used to Piazza.\nProgramming experience would definitely help since most of the assignments are python heavy especially vectorization for performance.\nOverall I never expected to learn so much about the Trading domain and now I feel fairly confident managing my own portfolio; which I think was a big plus for me on the financial front.\nThis course left me with an yearning for exploring the trading space - thanks to Tucker Balch - A great teacher indeed!!!",
